		<short_description>Abana, a river near Damascus, which Naaman saw as superior to the Jordan River.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Abana River is mentioned in 2 Kings 5:12 as one of the two rivers of Damascus, along with the Pharpar. When Elisha told Naaman, commander of the army of Syria, to wash in the Jordan River to cure his leprosy, Naaman initially refused, saying, &quot;Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?&quot; The Abana was apparently a significant and highly regarded river near Damascus. Naaman considered it superior to the Jordan River of Israel. After his servants reasoned with him, Naaman relented and washed in the Jordan as instructed, and his leprosy was cured. The Abana River is generally identified with the modern Barada River, the primary river that flows through Damascus.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Abdon, a town allotted to the Levites within the tribal territory of Asher.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Abdon, also called Ebron, was a town allotted to the Levites within the tribal territory of Asher (Joshua 21:30, 1 Chronicles 6:74). It was one of four cities given to the Gershonite Levites from the tribe of Asher (Joshua 21:27-31, 1 Chronicles 6:71-74). The parallel texts in Joshua and 1 Chronicles have different spellings of the name, Abdon versus Ebron, but clearly refer to the same town. Joshua 19:28 mentions Ebron in a list of towns within Asher's inheritance, confirming its location. No other details are given about Abdon in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was presumably near the other Levitical cities of Asher: Mashal, Hukkok and Rehob.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Abel-beth-maacah, a fortified city in northern Israel, near Dan.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Abel-beth-maacah, also known as Abel-maim, was a fortified city in northern Israel, located near the city of Dan. It was besieged by Joab, King David's commander, when Sheba son of Bikri took refuge there after rebelling against David (2 Samuel 20:14-15). The city was known for its wisdom, as seen in the saying, &quot;They used to say in former times, 'Let them inquire at Abel'&quot; (2 Samuel 20:18). During the reign of King Baasha of Israel, Abel-beth-maacah was captured by Ben-Hadad I of Syria, who was allied with King Asa of Judah (1 Kings 15:20; 2 Chronicles 16:4). Later, in the reign of Pekah of Israel, the city was captured by King Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria (2 Kings 15:29).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Abel-meholah was a town in Israel, located in the Jordan Valley, south of Beth-shean. It is first mentioned in Judges 7:22, where it is described as one of the places to which the Midianites fled after being defeated by Gideon. Later, in 1 Kings 4:12, Abel-meholah is listed as part of the district overseen by Baana son of Ahilud, one of Solomon's twelve district governors. The town is most notable as the birthplace of the prophet Elisha, as mentioned in 1 Kings 19:16, where God commands Elijah to anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as his successor.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Abilene was a region located north of Damascus, Syria, mentioned in Luke 3:1 as being under the rule of Lysanias the tetrarch when John the Baptist began his ministry. The name Abilene is derived from its capital city, Abila. Inscriptions found near Abila refer to a Lysanias as tetrarch and mention the &quot;Abilenians,&quot; confirming the existence of this region. The exact boundaries of Abilene are unclear, but it was situated in the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, likely in the area of the modern village of Suk Wady Barada. Abilene is only mentioned in passing in the Bible as a geographical reference point for the beginning of John's ministry.</ext_description>

The exact location of Akkad is unknown, but it was likely situated somewhere in northern Babylonia. The reference to Accad in Genesis 10 is part of the &quot;Table of Nations&quot; which describes the spread of Noah's descendants after the Flood. It shows that Nimrod, a descendant of Ham, established a powerful kingdom in Mesopotamia in the generations following the Flood.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Acco, later known as Ptolemais, was a seaport on the Mediterranean coast allotted to the tribe of Asher (Judges 1:31). However, Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Acco, so they continued to live among the Israelites. In the New Testament, the city is called Ptolemais, reflecting its Hellenistic name during the intertestamental period. The apostle Paul visited Ptolemais at the end of his third missionary journey and stayed there one day with the believers (Acts 21:7) before continuing on to Caesarea. Acco was an important port city throughout ancient history due to its strategic coastal location in northern Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Achaia, a Roman province covering much of Greece, with Corinth as its capital.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Achaia was a Roman province that encompassed much of southern Greece, including the cities of Athens and Corinth. It was established in 27 BC and lasted until the reforms of Diocletian in the late 3rd century AD. In the New Testament, Achaia is mentioned primarily in connection with Paul's ministry and the churches he established or visited in the region. ¶Paul spent considerable time in Corinth, the capital of Achaia, on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1-18). It was there that he was brought before the judgment seat of Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia (Acts 18:12). Later, Apollos visited Achaia and ministered in Corinth (Acts 18:27-19:1). ¶Paul wrote several epistles to churches in Achaia, including 1 and 2 Corinthians, addressed to the church in Corinth, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians to the church in Thessalonica, the capital of neighboring Macedonia. In his epistles, Paul commended the generosity of the churches of Achaia in giving to the collection for the believers in Jerusalem (Romans 15:26, 2 Corinthians 9:2) and noted their role in spreading the gospel (1 Thessalonians 1:7-8). ¶The churches in Achaia faced significant challenges, including divisions, immorality, and false teachings, as addressed in Paul's epistles to them. Nevertheless, Achaia remained an important center of early Christianity, producing influential leaders such as Stephanas (1 Corinthians 16:15) and Phoebe (Romans 16:1).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Valley of Achor, where Achan was punished for his sin.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Valley of Achor was a valley near Jericho where Achan, an Israelite, was stoned to death for taking forbidden plunder from the city of Jericho (Joshua 7:24-26). As a result, the valley was named &quot;Achor,&quot; which means &quot;trouble,&quot; because Achan had brought trouble upon Israel. The Valley of Achor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:7). ¶In later prophetic writings, the Valley of Achor is used symbolically. Isaiah 65:10 portrays it as a place of rest and abundance for God's people in the future messianic age. Hosea 2:15 describes it as a place of hope and restoration, where God will turn Israel's sorrow into joy, comparing it to a &quot;door of hope.&quot; These passages suggest that the Valley of Achor, once a place of judgment and trouble, will become a symbol of God's blessing and redemption for His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Achshaph, a Canaanite city defeated by Joshua and allotted to Asher.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Achshaph was a Canaanite city-state mentioned in the conquest narratives of the book of Joshua. Its king, along with other northern Canaanite kings, formed an alliance against Israel led by Jabin king of Hazor (Joshua 11:1). However, Joshua defeated this coalition, capturing and destroying their cities, including Achshaph (Joshua 11:10-23). Achshaph is listed among the kings defeated by Joshua (Joshua 12:20) and later allotted to the tribe of Asher (Joshua 19:25). The exact location of Achshaph is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the western Galilee region, north of Mount Carmel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Achzib was a coastal town allotted to the tribe of Asher (Joshua 19:29). However, Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Achzib, so they continued to live among the Israelites (Judges 1:31). This Achzib is distinct from the town of the same name in Judah. Its location is generally identified with the modern city of Ez-Zib, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Acco (Ptolemais) on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel. As a coastal settlement, Achzib was likely involved in maritime trade and commerce. The Canaanites' continued presence in Achzib reflects the challenges Israel faced in completely possessing the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Achzib, also known as Chezib or Cozeba, was a town located in the Shephelah (foothills) region of Judah (Joshua 15:44). It is first mentioned in Genesis 38:5 as the place where Judah's son Shelah was born. The town is later listed in the genealogies of Judah (1 Chronicles 4:22). ¶In Micah 1:14, Achzib is mentioned in a prophetic oracle of judgment against Judah, where it is described as a deception to the kings of Israel, possibly implying that the town would fail to provide the expected support or loyalty. The exact location of Achzib is debated, but it is generally identified with the ruins of Tel el-Beida, about 8 miles (13 km) southwest of Beit Gubrin (Eleutheropolis) in the Shephelah.</ext_description>

When the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant stepped into the Jordan, the river stopped flowing and piled up in a heap a great distance away at Adam, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. The exact location of Adam is uncertain, but it is described as being beside Zarethan, which is believed to be near the confluence of the Jabbok and Jordan Rivers, roughly 30 miles (48 km) north of Jericho. The damming of the Jordan at Adam demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in enabling Israel to enter the Promised Land.</ext_description>

These families, including the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, were unable to prove their Israelite ancestry or priestly lineage and were therefore excluded from the priesthood. The exact location of Addan is unknown, but it was likely a town or region in Babylonia where these exiled families had settled.

It was located in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea (Genesis 10:19). Admah, along with Zeboiim, allied with the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah in a rebellion against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies (Genesis 14:2,8). As a result, Admah and the other cities were defeated and plundered by Chedorlaomer's coalition. ¶Later, Admah was destroyed by God along with Sodom and Gomorrah because of their wickedness (Deuteronomy 29:23). The destruction of these cities is held up as an example of God's judgment against sin. The prophet Hosea also refers to Admah and Zeboiim as a warning to Israel, emphasizing the severity of God's potential judgment (Hosea 11:8). The exact location of Admah is unknown, as the cities of the plain were completely destroyed, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the Dead Sea basin.</ext_description>

After the division of the kingdom following Solomon's death, Rehoboam strengthened the defenses of Judah by building fortified cities, including Adoraim. These cities were strategically located to protect Judah's borders and key routes from potential attacks by the northern kingdom of Israel or other enemies. ¶The exact location of Adoraim is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, possibly southwest of Hebron. The name Adoraim means &quot;two mounds&quot; or &quot;double honor,&quot; perhaps referring to the city's topography or its importance.

		<ext_description>Adramyttium was a seaport on the northwest coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), mentioned in Acts 27:2 in connection with the apostle Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. Paul and other prisoners were placed on a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to ports along the coast of Asia Minor. The ship likely followed a common trade route, stopping at various ports to unload and load cargo and passengers. ¶Adramyttium was located in the region of Mysia, near the island of Lesbos. It was an important port city in the Roman province of Asia and a center for trade and commerce. The city was known for its shipbuilding industry and its strategic location along the Aegean coast. Apart from its mention in Paul's journey, Adramyttium does not play any other significant role in the biblical narrative. Its inclusion in Acts 27 provides a glimpse into the maritime travel and trade networks of the Roman Empire in the first century AD.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Adriatic Sea, where Paul's ship was driven by a storm on his journey to Rome.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Adriatic Sea is mentioned in Acts 27:27 as part of the narrative of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. During the voyage, Paul's ship encountered a severe storm, and they were driven by the wind for many days. On the fourteenth night of the storm, the sailors sensed they were approaching land and took soundings, fearing they might run aground on the rocks. ¶In the context of Acts 27, the term &quot;Adriatic Sea&quot; likely refers to a broader area that includes not only the modern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Croatia but also the central Mediterranean Sea south of Greece and west of Crete. This understanding is based on the usage of the term in ancient sources and the probable route of Paul's ship. ¶The storm that Paul's ship encountered was likely a Euraquilo, a strong northeasterly wind that blows in the Mediterranean during the winter months. The ship was eventually wrecked on the island of Malta (Acts 28:1), where Paul and the other survivors were welcomed by the islanders and spent three months before continuing their journey to Rome. The mention of the Adriatic Sea in Acts 27 highlights the dangers and challenges of maritime travel in the ancient world and provides a vivid backdrop for Paul's perilous journey to stand trial before Caesar.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Adullam, a city in Judah, known for its cave where David hid.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Adullam was a Canaanite city that was conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of Canaan (Joshua 12:15). It was later allotted to the tribe of Judah and listed among the cities in the Shephelah (lowlands) region (Joshua 15:35). During the time of King Saul, David fled from Saul and sought refuge in the cave of Adullam, where he was joined by about 400 men who were in distress, debt, or discontent (1 Samuel 22:1-2). ¶Later, during the reign of King David, three of his mighty men broke through the Philistine lines to bring him water from the well in Bethlehem, passing by the cave of Adullam (2 Samuel 23:13-17; 1 Chronicles 11:15-19). King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, fortified Adullam as part of his defensive strategy (2 Chronicles 11:7). After the Babylonian exile, Adullam was among the towns resettled by the people of Judah (Nehemiah 11:30). ¶The prophet Micah used Adullam as a symbol of the degradation and shame that would come upon the nobles of Israel because of their sins (Micah 1:15). In the story of Judah and Tamar, Judah was associated with the town of Adullam, where his friend Hirah lived (Genesis 38:1,12,20). Adullam's location is believed to be at Tel esh-Sheikh Madhkur, about 16 miles (26 km) southwest of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Adummim, a mountain pass on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Adummim was a mountain pass located on the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin, as described in Joshua 15:7 and 18:17. It is situated on the road that goes up from Jericho to Jerusalem, in the wilderness of Judah. The name Adummim means &quot;red&quot; or &quot;ruddy,&quot; possibly referring to the reddish color of the rocks or soil in the area. ¶In both references, Adummim is mentioned as a point along the boundary line between the two tribes, near the Stone of Bohan (son of Reuben) and the Valley of Achor. Its location is generally identified with Tal'at ed-Damm, a steep ascent on the modern Jericho-Jerusalem road, approximately halfway between the two cities. The pass of Adummim was known for its treacherous terrain and its association with robbers, as alluded to in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Aenon, a site near Salim where John the Baptist conducted baptisms.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Aenon is mentioned in John 3:23 as a place where John the Baptist was baptizing people because there was plenty of water there. It is described as being near Salim, which suggests that both locations were in the same general area. The exact location of Aenon is uncertain, but scholars have proposed several possible sites in the Jordan Valley, such as Wadi Farah (a perennial stream) or 'Ain Farah (a spring) near the Jordan River. ¶The name Aenon is derived from the Greek word &quot;aenon,&quot; meaning &quot;springs&quot; or &quot;fountains,&quot; indicating that the site had a plentiful water supply, which was necessary for John's baptismal ministry. The mention of Aenon in the context of John's ministry highlights the importance of baptism and the need for adequate water resources to perform this ritual. Some scholars also see the reference to Aenon as an indication of John's growing influence and the expanding scope of his ministry beyond the immediate region of the Jordan River.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ahava was a place near Babylon where Ezra assembled the Jewish exiles who were preparing to return to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:15). It was located by a river, also called Ahava, which is believed to be a canal or tributary of the Euphrates River. Ezra had sent for Levites and temple servants to join the group of returning exiles, and they gathered at Ahava before setting out on their journey. ¶At Ahava, Ezra proclaimed a fast for the people to humble themselves before God and seek His protection for their journey (Ezra 8:21). After the fast, the exiles set out from Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month and arrived safely in Jerusalem, thanks to the hand of God upon them (Ezra 8:31). The mention of Ahava in the book of Ezra highlights the importance of spiritual preparation and reliance on God's guidance and protection during the Jews' return from exile in Babylon.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ahlab (Mahalab), a city in Asher's territory, not conquered by the Israelites.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ahlab, also known as Mahalab, was a Canaanite city that was allotted to the tribe of Asher during the division of the Promised Land (Joshua 19:29). It was located in the western part of Galilee, near the Mediterranean coast. However, the tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Ahlab, and as a result, the Canaanites continued to live among them (Judges 1:31). ¶This failure to completely conquer and possess the allotted territory was a common problem for several Israelite tribes during the period of the judges. The continued presence of Canaanites in cities like Ahlab would have exposed the Israelites to the influence of pagan religions and practices, which ultimately led to spiritual decline and disobedience to God. The exact location of Ahlab is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the site of Khirbet el-Mahalib, about 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Tyre.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ai, a Canaanite city near Bethel, captured by Israel under Joshua.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ai was a Canaanite city located near Bethel, east of Jerusalem. It is first mentioned in Genesis 12:8 and 13:3, where Abraham built an altar between Bethel and Ai. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua sent spies to Ai, who reported that the city was small and could be easily defeated (Joshua 7:2-3). However, the Israelites were initially defeated because of Achan's sin (Joshua 7:4-5). ¶After dealing with Achan, Joshua set an ambush and conquered Ai, killing its inhabitants and burning the city (Joshua 8). The king of Ai was hanged, and a heap of stones was raised over his body (Joshua 8:29). The conquest of Ai opened the way for the Israelites to advance into the heart of Canaan (Joshua 9:3; 10:1-2). Ai is listed among the cities defeated by Joshua (Joshua 12:9). ¶After the Babylonian exile, some people from Ai returned to Jerusalem (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32). Ai was resettled by the Benjamites (Nehemiah 11:31). The city is also mentioned in Isaiah 10:28 as part of a prophetic description of the Assyrian invasion of Judah. The exact location of Ai is debated, but it is generally identified with et-Tell, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southeast of Bethel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>In Jeremiah 49:3, Ai is mentioned as a city of the Ammonites, a people group living east of the Jordan River. This Ai is distinct from the Canaanite city of the same name. The prophet Jeremiah foretells the destruction of Ai and other Ammonite cities as part of a divine judgment against the Ammonites for their pride and hostility towards Israel (Jeremiah 49:1-6). ¶The prophecy states that Ai will be destroyed, and its people will flee in terror. The Ammonites are called to lament and run to and fro, for their god Milcom will go into exile along with his priests and officials. This prophecy was likely fulfilled during the Babylonian conquest of the region under Nebuchadnezzar II in the early 6th century BC. The exact location of this Ammonite city of Ai is unknown.</ext_description>

It is most famously known as the place where Joshua commanded the moon to stand still during the battle against the Amorite kings (Joshua 10:12). The city was allotted to the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:42) and later designated as a Levitical city for the Kohathites (Joshua 21:24; 1 Chronicles 6:69). ¶After the conquest of Canaan, the Amorites continued to dwell in Aijalon, and the Danites failed to drive them out completely (Judges 1:35). Elon, a judge of Israel, was buried in Aijalon (Judges 12:12). During Saul's reign, the Israelites pursued the Philistines as far as Aijalon (1 Samuel 14:31). Some descendants of Benjamin, including the family of Beriah, lived in Aijalon (1 Chronicles 8:13). ¶King Rehoboam of Judah fortified Aijalon as part of his defensive strategy (2 Chronicles 11:10). Later, during the reign of King Ahaz, the Philistines captured Aijalon and settled there (2 Chronicles 28:18). The city is generally identified with the modern village of Yalo, about 13 miles (21 km) northwest of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ain or En-rimmon was a city located in the Negev region of Judah, south of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the list of cities allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:32) and later as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon (Joshua 19:7; 1 Chronicles 4:32). The city was also designated as a Levitical city for the descendants of Aaron (Joshua 21:16). ¶The name Ain means &quot;spring&quot; or &quot;fountain,&quot; while Rimmon means &quot;pomegranate.&quot; It is possible that the city was named for a nearby spring and the presence of pomegranate trees. After the Babylonian exile, some people from En-rimmon resettled in Judah (Nehemiah 11:29). ¶The exact location of Ain or En-rimmon is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the modern village of Umm er-Rumamim, about 9 miles (14.5 km) northeast of Beersheba. The city's mention in various tribal allotments and its designation as a Levitical city highlight its importance in the southern part of Judah's territory.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ain or Rimmon is mentioned in Numbers 34:11 as a place on the eastern boundary of the Promised Land, as described in the instructions for dividing the land among the Israelite tribes. It is listed between Shepham and the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee), indicating its location in the northern part of the territory. ¶The name Ain means &quot;spring&quot; or &quot;fountain,&quot; while Rimmon means &quot;pomegranate.&quot; It is unclear whether these refer to two separate places or a single location with a compound name. In Zechariah 14:10, Rimmon is mentioned as a southern point in a prophetic description of the future transformation of Jerusalem and its surroundings. However, this Rimmon is likely a different location, as it is described as being south of Jerusalem. ¶The exact location of the Ain or Rimmon mentioned in Numbers 34:11 is uncertain, but it was probably situated somewhere in the region east of the Sea of Galilee, in what later became the territory of the tribe of Naphtali.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Akeldama, also known as the Field of Blood or Potter's Field, was purchased with the money Judas received for betraying Jesus and used as a burial place for foreigners.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Akeldama, which means &quot;Field of Blood&quot; in Aramaic, is mentioned in the New Testament as the field purchased with the thirty pieces of silver that Judas Iscariot received for betraying Jesus (Matthew 27:7-8; Acts 1:18-19). It is also known as the Potter's Field. ¶According to Matthew's account, when Judas realized the consequences of his betrayal, he returned the money to the chief priests and elders. However, they considered it unlawful to put the money into the temple treasury, as it was &quot;blood money.&quot; Instead, they used the money to purchase a potter's field as a burial place for foreigners (Matthew 27:7). ¶In Acts, the field is called Akeldama, and it is stated that Judas bought the field with the reward of his wickedness and fell headlong there, bursting open in the middle, and his intestines gushed out (Acts 1:18). The field was then known as the Field of Blood because of its association with Judas' death and the blood money used to purchase it. ¶The location of Akeldama is traditionally identified as a site south of Jerusalem, near the junction of the Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. The area has been used as a burial ground for centuries, with numerous tombs and burial caves dating from ancient times to the present day. ¶The purchase of Akeldama with the money from Judas' betrayal is seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, as stated in Matthew 27:9-10, which quotes from Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. The field serves as a reminder of the tragic consequences of Judas' betrayal and the ultimate redemption brought about by Jesus' sacrifice.</ext_description>

The name suggests that the site was associated with a notable oak tree and that mourning took place there.

The mention of her burial at Allon-bacuth indicates her importance to the household and the sorrow felt at her passing. The location of Allon-bacuth is described as being below Bethel, which is situated in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Jerusalem. The specific event of Deborah's burial and the naming of the site as Allon-bacuth highlight the significance of the event in the life of Jacob's family and the enduring memory associated with the place.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in Numbers 33:13-14 as being located between Dophkah and Rephidim in the Sinai Peninsula. The Israelites arrived at Alush after departing from Dophkah and subsequently traveled to Rephidim. No specific events are recorded as having taken place at Alush, suggesting it was simply a stopover point during the journey. The exact location of Alush is unknown, as are many of the campsites mentioned in the Exodus itinerary. Its inclusion in the list of encampments helps to trace the route taken by the Israelites on their way to Mount Sinai and ultimately to the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Amalek, a nomadic tribe descended from Esau, who were persistent enemies of Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Amalek was a nomadic people group descended from Esau's grandson, Eliphaz (Genesis 36:12; 1 Chronicles 1:36). They inhabited the desert regions of the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev. The Amalekites were the first nation to attack Israel after the Exodus, at Rephidim (Exodus 17:8-16). Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur, interceded for Israel while Joshua led the army in battle. As a result, God declared that He would be at war with Amalek from generation to generation (Exodus 17:16). ¶The Amalekites, along with other enemies, continued to harass Israel during the period of the judges (Judges 3:13; 6:3,33; 7:12; 10:12). Saul, Israel's first king, was commanded to completely destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:2-3). However, he disobeyed by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the livestock (1 Samuel 15:7-9). This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king (1 Samuel 15:23; 28:18). ¶During David's reign, the Amalekites were among the enemies he defeated (1 Samuel 30:1-20; 2 Samuel 8:12; 1 Chronicles 18:11). The last mention of the Amalekites is in 1 Chronicles 4:43, which records that some of the Simeonites destroyed the remnant of the Amalekites during the time of Hezekiah. ¶The Amalekites are also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts as symbols of Israel's enemies (Numbers 24:20; Psalm 83:7). Their persistent opposition to Israel and their role in the narratives of Saul and David make them significant adversaries in the biblical history of Israel.</ext_description>

As part of Judah's inheritance, Amam would have been settled by members of the tribe following the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Amana, a mountain range featured in a poetic description of the beloved's beauty.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Amana is mentioned in Song of Solomon 4:8 as part of a poetic description of the beloved's beauty. In the verse, the lover invites his beloved to come with him from Lebanon, from the top of Amana, Senir, and Hermon, where lions and leopards dwell. The context suggests that Amana is a mountain range, likely located in the region of Lebanon. ¶Some scholars identify Amana with the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, which runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains on the eastern side of the Beqaa Valley. Others associate it with Mount Amanus, a range located in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border. The exact identification remains uncertain. ¶The mention of Amana in the Song of Solomon is part of a literary device that uses geographical references to emphasize the beauty and desirability of the beloved. By associating her with the grandeur and majesty of the mountains, the lover expresses his admiration and love for her.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Amaw, a place near the Euphrates, where Balaam son of Beor lived.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Amaw is mentioned in Numbers 22:5 as the place where Balaam son of Beor lived. Balaam was a prophet or diviner who was summoned by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites as they approached the Promised Land. The verse describes Amaw as being near the river, likely referring to the Euphrates River, in the land of the Amawites. ¶The exact location of Amaw is uncertain, but it was probably situated in the region of Aram-naharaim (Aram of the two rivers), which is associated with the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. This places Amaw in a region known for its ancient civilizations and cultural influences. ¶Apart from its association with Balaam, no other information about Amaw is provided in the Bible. Its mention in the context of Balaam's story highlights the international scope of his reputation as a diviner and the far-reaching concern surrounding the Israelites' advance toward Canaan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ammah, a hill near Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ammah is mentioned in 2 Samuel 2:24 as a hill located near Giah, on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. The context is the pursuit of Abner, the commander of Saul's army, by Joab and Abishai, who were commanders in David's army. After a battle at Gibeon, Abner and his men fled, with Joab and Abishai in pursuit. ¶The verse states that Joab and Abishai reached the hill of Ammah as the sun was setting. The exact location of Ammah is not specified, but it was likely situated in the region of Gibeon, a short distance northwest of Jerusalem. The hill of Ammah may have been a prominent landmark or a strategic vantage point in the area. ¶Apart from this single mention in the narrative of the conflict between David's and Saul's forces, no other information about Ammah is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the text serves to provide a geographical reference point for the pursuit and to emphasize the distance covered by Joab and Abishai in their attempt to capture Abner.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ammon, a nation descended from Lot, and its capital Rabbah, often in conflict with Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ammon was an ancient nation located east of the Jordan River, in the region known as the Transjordan. The Ammonites were descendants of Ben-ammi, the son of Lot by his younger daughter (Genesis 19:38). They inhabited the area north of Moab and east of the tribe of Reuben. ¶Throughout history, the Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel. During the time of the judges, the Ammonites oppressed Israel (Judges 10:6-9) until Jephthah defeated them (Judges 11). Saul fought against the Ammonites and rescued Jabesh-gilead from their siege (1 Samuel 11:1-11). David, during his reign, also engaged in battles with the Ammonites (2 Samuel 10; 12:26-31). ¶The Ammonite capital city was Rabbah (also known as Rabbath-Ammon), which was besieged and captured by Joab, David's commander (2 Samuel 12:26-29). The city later became part of the Ammonite territory again. The Ammonites were known for their worship of the god Milcom (1 Kings 11:5,33; 2 Kings 23:13). ¶The prophets often spoke against Ammon for their hostility towards Israel and predicted their downfall (Jeremiah 49:1-6; Ezekiel 21:28-32; 25:1-7; Amos 1</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Amphipolis was a city in the region of Macedonia, located along the Strymon River, about 3 miles (5 km) from the Aegean Sea. It is mentioned in Acts 17:1 as one of the places Paul and Silas passed through on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica during Paul's second missionary journey. ¶The city was an important military and economic center, situated on the main Roman road, the Via Egnatia, which connected the Adriatic Sea with the Hellespont. Amphipolis was originally an Athenian colony but later came under Macedonian and then Roman control. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities in Amphipolis, the mention of the city in the context of his journey highlights the strategic importance of the Via Egnatia for the spread of the gospel in the region. The inclusion of Amphipolis in the itinerary demonstrates Paul's intentional efforts to reach major cities and transportation hubs with the message of Christ.</ext_description>

During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua defeated the Anakim, a race of giants, and captured the city of Anab along with Debir and Hebron (Joshua 11:21). Later, in the description of the territory allotted to Judah, Anab is listed among the cities in the hill country (Joshua 15:50). ¶The exact location of Anab is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Debir and Hebron, which are approximately 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Jerusalem. The city's capture by Joshua and its inclusion in the list of Judah's cities highlight its importance in the region during the early stages of Israel's settlement in the Promised Land. ¶No other information about Anab is provided in the Bible, and the city is not mentioned in any other context. Its significance lies primarily in its association with the conquest of Canaan and the defeat of the Anakim, which marked a crucial step in Israel's possession of the land promised to their forefathers.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Anathoth, a Levitical city in Benjamin, notable as the birthplace of Jeremiah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Anathoth was a city in the territory of Benjamin, located approximately 3 miles (5 km) northeast of Jerusalem. It was assigned to the Levites, specifically the descendants of Aaron, as one of their cities (Joshua 21:18; 1 Chronicles 6:60). ¶The city is most notably associated with the prophet Jeremiah, who was born in Anathoth (Jeremiah 1:1). Jeremiah faced opposition from the people of his hometown, who plotted against his life because of his prophecies (Jeremiah 11:21-23). The prophet also received a divine command to purchase a field in Anathoth, which served as a sign of the future restoration of Judah (Jeremiah 32:7-9). ¶Several prominent figures in the Bible were associated with Anathoth, including Abiathar, a priest during the reign of King Solomon, who was exiled to Anathoth after supporting Adonijah's claim to the throne (1 Kings 2:26). Two of David's mighty men, Abiezer and Jehu, were also from Anathoth (2 Samuel 23:27; 1 Chronicles 11:28; 12:3; 27:12). ¶Anathoth was among the towns resettled by the Benjamites after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:23; Nehemiah 7:27; 11:32). The city is also mentioned in a prophetic context, as Isaiah declares judgment upon it (Isaiah 10:30), and Jeremiah confronts a false prophet from Anathoth named Pashhur (Jeremiah 29:27). ¶The biblical references to Anathoth highlight its significance as a Levitical city, its connection to the life and ministry of Jeremiah, and its role in the history of Israel, particularly during the divided monarchy and the post-exilic period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Angle, a fortified tower constructed by Uzziah in Jerusalem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Angle is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 26:9 as one of the towers built by King Uzziah of Judah in Jerusalem. The verse states that Uzziah constructed towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, fortifying them. The exact location of the Angle is not specified, but it was likely a strategic point in the city's defensive system, possibly at a bend or corner in the wall. ¶King Uzziah, who reigned in the 8th century BC, was known for his military achievements and building projects. The construction of the Angle tower was part of his efforts to strengthen Jerusalem's fortifications. By building towers at key locations, Uzziah aimed to improve the city's security and protect it from potential enemy attacks. ¶Apart from this single mention in the context of Uzziah's building activities, no other information about the Angle is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the chronicle of Uzziah's reign highlights the king's dedication to enhancing Jerusalem's defenses and his overall success as a ruler.</ext_description>

It is listed among other towns such as Eshtemoh, Goshen, and Holon, indicating its location in the southern part of Judah's territory. The exact site of Anim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Hebron, a major city in the hill country. ¶The allocation of Anim to Judah is part of the detailed description of the tribal territories in the book of Joshua. After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. The listing of cities and towns, including Anim, demonstrates the systematic distribution of the land and the establishment of Judah's presence in the region. ¶Apart from its mention in the list of Judah's cities, no other information about Anim is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the territorial allotment highlights its significance as a settlement in the hill country during the early period of Israel's history in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Antioch, a city in Syria where the gospel first reached Gentiles and the believers were first called Christians.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Antioch, located in Syria, was a significant city in the early spread of Christianity. After the persecution that followed Stephen's martyrdom, some believers from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and preached the gospel to the Hellenists (Greeks) there (Acts 11:19-20). The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch, who encouraged the believers and brought Saul (Paul) there to teach (Acts 11:22-26). ¶It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians (Acts 11:26). The city became a hub for missionary activity, with Paul and Barnabas being sent out from Antioch on their first missionary journey (Acts 13:1-3; 14:26). The church in Antioch also played a crucial role in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law (Acts 15:1-35). ¶Antioch was the home church of several notable figures, including the prophet Agabus (Acts 11:27-28) and the evangelist Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch (Acts 6:5). The apostle Peter visited Antioch, where Paul confronted him about his inconsistent behavior regarding Gentile believers (Galatians 2:11-14). ¶The church in Antioch became a model of a multicultural, mission-oriented congregation, demonstrating the power of the gospel to transcend cultural barriers and unite believers in Christ. Its strategic location and the fervor of its believers made Antioch a launching pad for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Antioch in Pisidia, a city visited by Paul on his missionary journeys.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Antioch in Pisidia, also known as Pisidian Antioch, was a city located in the region of Pisidia in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas visited Antioch in Pisidia, where Paul preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 13:14-41). ¶Paul's message in the synagogue focused on Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the offer of forgiveness of sins through faith in Him. While some of the Jews and proselytes believed, others rejected the message and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, forcing them to leave the city (Acts 13:42-52). ¶Later, on their return journey, Paul and Barnabas revisited Antioch in Pisidia, strengthening the disciples and appointing elders in the church (Acts 14:21-23). However, the city continued to be a place of opposition, as Jews from Antioch and Iconium followed Paul and Barnabas to Lystra, where they stoned Paul and left him for dead (Acts 14:19-20). ¶In his second letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions and sufferings he endured in Antioch, along with Iconium and Lystra, highlighting the challenges he faced while preaching the gospel in these cities (2 Timothy 3:11). ¶The events in Antioch in Pisidia demonstrate the mixed response to the gospel message, with some embracing it and others violently opposing it. Despite the difficulties, the church in Antioch in Pisidia was established and strengthened through Paul's ministry.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Antipatris was a city located in the region of Samaria, approximately 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in Acts 23:31 in connection with the apostle Paul's transfer from Jerusalem to Caesarea. After a plot against Paul's life was uncovered, the Roman commander ordered soldiers to escort Paul to Antipatris by night, ensuring his safety. ¶The city of Antipatris was built by Herod the Great and named after his father, Antipater. It was situated in a strategic location along the major road connecting Jerusalem to Caesarea, the Roman capital of Judea. The soldiers brought Paul to Antipatris, where they likely rested before continuing the journey to Caesarea the following day. ¶The mention of Antipatris in the account of Paul's transfer highlights the Roman authorities' concern for his safety and their efforts to protect him from the Jewish conspirators who sought to kill him. The city served as a stopover point on the journey, allowing the soldiers to cover a significant distance from Jerusalem and ensuring Paul's secure arrival in Caesarea. ¶Apart from this single reference in the context of Paul's transfer, no other information about Antipatris is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the narrative demonstrates the historical and geographical accuracy of the biblical account and the efficiency of the Roman military in transporting prisoners.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Aphek, mentioned in 1 Kings 20 and 2 Kings 13, was a city located in the northern part of Israel, likely in the region of the Jezreel Valley. It was the site of significant battles between the Arameans (Syrians) and the Israelites during the reigns of King Ahab and King Jehoash of Israel. ¶In 1 Kings 20, the Arameans, led by Ben-hadad, assembled their forces at Aphek to fight against Israel. Despite the vast Aramean army, the Israelites, guided by a prophet, achieved a decisive victory. The Arameans fled to Aphek, where a wall collapsed and killed many of them (1 Kings 20:26-30). ¶Later, during the reign of Jehoash, Aphek is mentioned again in the context of the Aramean oppression of Israel. The prophet Elisha, on his deathbed, instructed King Jehoash to shoot an arrow from the window, symbolizing the Lord's arrow of victory over the Arameans at Aphek (2 Kings 13:17). ¶The precise location of this Aphek is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Fiq, a site in the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley, near the modern-day town of Kibbutz Afik. Its location in the north made it a strategic point for military campaigns between Israel and Aram.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in Joshua 13:4 as part of the land that remained to be conquered after Joshua's initial campaigns. The city was later included in the list of cities given to the tribe of Asher (Joshua 19:30). ¶However, the tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Aphek, as recorded in Judges 1:31. This failure to completely possess their allotted territory was a recurring issue for several Israelite tribes during the period of the judges. ¶The exact location of this Aphek in Asher's territory is uncertain, but it is generally associated with Tel Afek, a site near the Mediterranean coast, about 8 miles (13 km) north of Acco. Its proximity to the coast suggests that it may have been a strategic port city. ¶Apart from these brief mentions in the context of the land allotment and the incomplete conquest, no other significant events or details are recorded about this Aphek in the Bible.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in Joshua 12:18 as one of the cities defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. Later, Aphek was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:53). ¶The city is most notably associated with the conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. In 1 Samuel 4:1, the Israelites camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek. The Philistines defeated the Israelites in battle and captured the Ark of the Covenant. Years later, during the reign of King Saul, the Philistines gathered their forces at Aphek before the fateful battle at Mount Gilboa, where Saul and his sons were killed (1 Samuel 29:1). ¶The exact location of Aphek in the Shephelah is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Tel Aphek, a site near the Yarkon River, about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Joppa. The city's strategic location along the coastal plain made it a significant military stronghold and a focal point of the ongoing struggles between Israel and the Philistines.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in Acts 17:1 as one of the cities through which Paul and his companions passed on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica during Paul's second missionary journey. ¶The text does not provide any details about Paul's activities or the duration of his stay in Apollonia. It simply states that they passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia before arriving in Thessalonica. This suggests that Apollonia was a transit point along the route, and Paul's primary focus was on reaching Thessalonica, where he spent significant time preaching and establishing a church. ¶Apollonia was situated about 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Amphipolis and about 37 miles (60 km) northeast of Thessalonica. The city was named after the Greek god Apollo and was known for its strategic location and commercial importance. ¶The mention of Apollonia in the context of Paul's journey highlights the apostle's systematic approach to evangelizing major cities and his use of the well-established Roman road system to facilitate his travel and the spread of the gospel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ar was the capital city of Moab, a kingdom located east of the Dead Sea in what is now modern-day Jordan. The city is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of Israel's journey through the wilderness and in prophetic messages concerning Moab. ¶During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, they passed through the territory of Moab. God instructed them not to harass or provoke the Moabites, as He had given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession (Deuteronomy 2:9). The Israelites bypassed Ar and continued their journey (Deuteronomy 2:18). ¶In Numbers 21, the Israelites' journey is described, mentioning the valleys that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab (Numbers 21:15). Later in the chapter, a poetic passage refers to a fire that came out of Heshbon and consumed Ar of Moab (Numbers 21:28), likely alluding to a past military conquest. ¶The prophet Isaiah also mentions Ar in his prophecy against Moab, declaring that Ar is laid waste and destroyed in a night (Isaiah 15:1). This prophecy foretells the coming judgment on Moab and its capital city. ¶The exact location of Ar is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the modern city of Rabba, about 15 miles (24 km) south of the Arnon River. As the capital of Moab, Ar would have been a significant political and economic center in the region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Arab, a town in the hill country of Judah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Arab is mentioned in Joshua 15:52 as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Judah in the hill country. It is listed among other towns such as Dumah, Eshean, and Janim, indicating its location in the southern part of Judah's territory. The exact site of Arab is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Hebron, a major city in the hill country. ¶The allocation of Arab to Judah is part of the detailed description of the tribal territories in the book of Joshua. After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. The listing of cities and towns, including Arab, demonstrates the systematic distribution of the land and the establishment of Judah's presence in the region. ¶Apart from its mention in the list of Judah's cities, no other information about Arab is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the territorial allotment highlights its significance as a settlement in the hill country during the early period of Israel's history in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Arabah, a desert plain extending from the Sea of Galilee to the Gulf of Aqaba.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Arabah, also known as the desert or plain, is a geographic region mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament. It refers to the elongated depression that runs from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, including the Jordan Valley and the area south of the Dead Sea. ¶In the book of Deuteronomy, the Arabah is mentioned in the context of Moses' farewell address to the Israelites, recounting their journey from Horeb (Sinai) to the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 1:1, 7; 2:8). The Arabah is described as part of the route they took and as a region they passed through. ¶The Arabah is also mentioned in the book of Joshua as a reference point for the boundaries of the tribal allotments (Joshua 11:16; 12:1, 3, 8; 18:18). It served as a natural border between the territories of the tribes settling in Canaan. ¶In the historical books, the Arabah is associated with events such as David's flight from Absalom (2 Samuel 2:29; 4:7) and the escape of King Zedekiah from Jerusalem during the Babylonian invasion (2 Kings 25:4; Jeremiah 39:4; 52:7). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel mention the Arabah in their prophecies. Isaiah speaks of the Arabah as a place of desolation (Isaiah 33:9), while Ezekiel envisions a future restoration where the waters flowing from the temple will bring life to the Arabah (Ezekiel 47:8). ¶The Arabah's arid climate and sparse vegetation make it a challenging environment. However, its strategic location along trade routes and its unique geological features, such as the Dead Sea, have made it a significant region throughout biblical history.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Arabia, a desert region southeast of Israel, known for trade and nomadic tribes.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Arabia is a vast desert region located southeast of Israel, encompassing the Arabian Peninsula. In the Bible, Arabia and its inhabitants, the Arabs or Arbites, are mentioned in various contexts, ranging from commercial interactions to prophetic messages. ¶The Queen of Sheba, who visited King Solomon, is said to have brought gifts from Arabia, including gold, spices, and precious stones (1 Kings 10:15; 2 Chronicles 9:14). The Arabians also paid tribute to King Jehoshaphat of Judah (2 Chronicles 17:11) and were among the enemies who attacked Judah during the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah (2 Chronicles 21:16; 22:1). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel mention Arabia and its inhabitants in their prophecies. Isaiah delivers a message concerning Arabia, foretelling the decline of its glory (Isaiah 21:13-17). Jeremiah includes the kings of Arabia among those who will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:24). Ezekiel lists Arabia as one of the nations that traded with Tyre (Ezekiel 27:21) and includes the Arabians among the allies of Egypt who will fall (Ezekiel 30:5). ¶In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul mentions his visit to Arabia after his conversion (Galatians 1:17) and uses Mount Sinai in Arabia as an allegory for the earthly Jerusalem (Galatians 4:25). On the day of Pentecost, Arabs were among the people who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11). ¶The Arabians were known for their nomadic lifestyle, traveling through the desert with their herds and engaging in trade. They were skilled in archery and horsemanship, making them formidable opponents in warfare. ¶Throughout the Bible, Arabia and its people are portrayed as having both positive and negative interactions with Israel and the surrounding nations, reflecting the complex dynamics of the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Arad was a Canaanite city located in the Negev desert. During Israel's wilderness journey, the king of Arad attacked the Israelites and took some of them captive (Num. 21:1). Israel vowed to destroy the city if God gave them victory, which they did, renaming the place Hormah (Num. 21:2-3). Later, after the conquest of Canaan, Arad was included in the list of cities defeated by Joshua (Jos. 12:14). In the time of the judges, the Kenites, descendants of Moses' father-in-law, settled in the wilderness of Judah, south of Arad (Jdg. 1:16). The city's mentions in the Bible highlight its strategic location and its interactions with the Israelites during their early history.</ext_description>

During the reign of King David, the Ammonites hired soldiers from Aram-maacah and other Aramean kingdoms to help fight against Israel (1 Chronicles 19:6-7). The Aramean forces, including the army of Maacah, gathered at the city of Medeba. Joab, David's commander, defeated the Aramean coalition, and the Arameans made peace with Israel (1 Chronicles 19:8-19). No other details are provided about the kingdom of Aram-maacah, its rulers, or its later history.

This region, located in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, was the homeland of the Arameans, a Semitic people group.

David's confrontation with Aram-naharaim demonstrates the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the surrounding nations as the Israelite kingdom expanded and sought to establish its dominance in the region. ¶Apart from this single reference in the psalm title, no other details about David's specific battle against Aram-naharaim are provided in the Bible.

Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located in central Syria, north of Damascus. The Arameans of Zobah were among the enemies Israel faced during the time of the united monarchy. ¶The title of the psalm suggests that David engaged in a military campaign against Aram-zobah, likely seeking to expand Israel's influence and control in the region. The conflict with Aram-zobah is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:3-8 and 1 Chronicles 18:3-8, which describe David's victories over Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, and his allies. ¶David's success against Aram-zobah and the acquisition of valuable resources, such as gold, silver, and bronze, contributed to the strengthening of Israel's position and wealth during his reign. The mention of Aram-zobah in the psalm title serves as a reminder of David's military prowess and the challenges he faced in establishing Israel's dominance in the region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ararat, the mountain range where Noah's ark came to rest after the flood.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ararat is a mountain range located in the region of Armenia, in present-day eastern Turkey. It is most famously known as the place where Noah's ark came to rest after the great flood, as recorded in Genesis 8:4. The specific mountain is often identified as Mount Ararat, which consists of two peaks: Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat. ¶In the Bible, Ararat is also mentioned in the context of historical events. In 2 Kings 19:37 and Isaiah 37:38, it is recorded that Adrammelech and Sharezer, the sons of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, fled to the land of Ararat after assassinating their father. This suggests that Ararat was a recognized geographical and political entity during the time of the Assyrian Empire. ¶Furthermore, in Jeremiah 51:27, Ararat is mentioned alongside Minni and Ashkenaz as kingdoms summoned to rise up against Babylon. This prophetic passage foretells the fall of Babylon and the role that the kingdoms of Ararat and its allies would play in this event. ¶The biblical references to Ararat highlight its significance as a geographical landmark and its association with important events in biblical history, most notably the landing of Noah's ark and the preservation of life after the flood. The mention of Ararat in the context of political alliances and conflicts also demonstrates its relevance in the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill, was a prominent hill located in the city of Athens, Greece. It served as a meeting place for the Athenian council, which was responsible for judicial and legislative matters in the city. The Areopagus is most notably mentioned in Acts 17 in connection with the Apostle Paul's visit to Athens during his second missionary journey. ¶According to Acts 17:19, some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered Paul and brought him to the Areopagus to inquire about his teachings. They were intrigued by Paul's message about Jesus and the resurrection, which they considered to be foreign concepts. ¶Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, Paul delivered a powerful speech, addressing the religious and philosophical beliefs of the Athenians (Acts 17:22-31). He observed that the city was full of idols and even found an altar dedicated to an &quot;unknown god.&quot; Paul used this as a starting point to proclaim the one true God, the Creator of all things, who is not confined to man-made temples or idols. ¶Paul's message at the Areopagus emphasized the sovereignty of God, the need for repentance, and the reality of the resurrection and coming judgment through Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus council, and a woman named Damaris (Acts 17:34). ¶The account of Paul's preaching at the Areopagus demonstrates his ability to engage with the intellectual and philosophical currents of his time, adapting his message to the audience while remaining faithful to the core truths of the gospel. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities the early church faced in proclaiming the message of Christ in a diverse and pluralistic society.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Argob, a region in Bashan, conquered by the Israelites and known for its many fortified cities.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Argob was a region located in the kingdom of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, in what is now modern-day Syria. It is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses and Joshua. ¶In Deuteronomy 3:4, Argob is described as a region containing sixty fortified cities, all of which were captured by the Israelites during their conquest of Og, the king of Bashan. These cities were noted for their high walls, gates, and bars, indicating their strong defensive capabilities (Deuteronomy 3:5). ¶The region of Argob was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 3:13). Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of Argob and named it Havvoth-jair, which means &quot;the towns of Jair&quot; (Deuteronomy 3:14). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Argob was included in the territory governed by one of his twelve officers, who was responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household (1 Kings 4:13). ¶The biblical references to Argob highlight its significance as a fortified and strategically important region in the Transjordan area. The conquest of Argob by the Israelites demonstrates their military success under divine guidance and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. The region's inclusion in the allotment of the tribes and its mention during Solomon's reign underscore its ongoing importance in the history of Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Arnon, a river and valley that marked the boundary between Moab and the Amorites, later serving as Israel's southern border.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Arnon is a river and its accompanying valley, located east of the Dead Sea, in what is now modern-day Jordan. It is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament, primarily in the context of Israel's journey to the Promised Land and the subsequent division of the territory. ¶During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, the Arnon served as a boundary between the Moabites and the Amorites (Numbers 21:13). The Amorites, led by King Sihon, had previously conquered the land north of the Arnon from the Moabites (Numbers 21:26). When the Israelites requested passage through Sihon's territory, he refused and engaged them in battle. Israel defeated Sihon and took possession of the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok (Numbers 21:24). ¶The Arnon later served as the southern border of the territory assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12, 16; Joshua 13:9, 16). It also marked the southern limit of the region controlled by King Sihon (Deuteronomy 2:36; Joshua 12:2) and, in later years, the extent of Jephthah's victories over the Ammonites (Judges 11:18, 22). ¶During the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory east of the Jordan, including the area from the Arnon, was lost to Hazael, king of Aram (2 Kings 10:33). The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah also mention the Arnon in their prophecies concerning Moab (Isaiah 16:2; Jeremiah 48:20). ¶The Arnon's significance in the Bible lies in its role as a geographical boundary, marking the limits of territorial control for various nations and tribes throughout Israel's history. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a strategic landmark in the region.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Aroer is mentioned in 1 Samuel 30:28 as one of the cities in Judah that received a share of the spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites. This Aroer is distinct from the cities of the same name located in the Transjordan region. ¶After David and his men defeated the Amalekites, who had raided and burned Ziklag, they recovered all the captives and plunder (1 Samuel 30:18-20). David sent portions of the spoils to the elders of Judah and to his friends in various cities, including Aroer (1 Samuel 30:26-31). ¶The exact location of this Aroer in Judah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the tribe's territory. David's act of sharing the spoils with Aroer and other cities demonstrates his desire to strengthen his relationship with the people of Judah and to show gratitude for their support. ¶Apart from this single reference in the context of David's distribution of the Amalekite spoils, no other information about this specific Aroer is provided in the Bible. Its mention highlights David's strategic and diplomatic efforts to consolidate his position as the future king of Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Aroer, a city situated on the edge of the Arnon Valley, near the border between Israel and Moab.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Aroer was a city located on the northern edge of the Arnon Valley, in what is now modern-day Jordan. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often in the context of defining territorial boundaries and military campaigns. ¶In Deuteronomy 2:36, Aroer is described as being on the edge of the Arnon Valley, marking the southern limit of the territory conquered by the Israelites from King Sihon of the Amorites. This area was later allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Deuteronomy 3:12; Joshua 13:9, 16). ¶Aroer is also mentioned in the description of the extent of King Sihon's territory, which stretched from the Arnon to the Jabbok (Joshua 12:2). During the time of the judges, Jephthah reminded the Ammonites that Israel had possessed the land from Aroer to the Jabbok for three hundred years (Judges 11:26). ¶In the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory from Aroer was lost to Hazael, king of Aram (2 Kings 10:33). The prophet Jeremiah also mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Moab, calling upon the inhabitants of Aroer to ask about the destruction that has come upon them (Jeremiah 48:19). ¶Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its strategic location along the Arnon Valley, serving as a boundary marker and a point of reference in territorial descriptions. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a key city in the region.</ext_description>

According to Numbers 32:34, the Gadites built Aroer, along with other cities in the region, after the conquest of the land under Moses' leadership. ¶Aroer is mentioned in Joshua 13:25 as part of the description of Gad's territory, situated near the border with the Ammonites. The city is also noted in the account of Jephthah's victory over the Ammonites, where he is said to have struck them from Aroer to Minnith (Judges 11:33). ¶During King David's reign, Aroer is mentioned in the context of the census he conducted, which began at Aroer and continued throughout the regions east of the Jordan (2 Samuel 24:5). The city was also the hometown of Shamgar, one of David's mighty men (1 Chronicles 11:44). ¶The prophet Isaiah mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Damascus, stating that the cities of Aroer will be forsaken (Isaiah 17:2). This suggests that Aroer, along with other cities in the region, would face judgment and desolation. ¶Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its association with the tribe of Gad and its location in the Transjordan region. The city's mention in various contexts, from the initial settlement of the land to the reigns of David and the prophetic messages, highlights its enduring presence throughout Israel's history.</ext_description>

In Judges 9:41, Arumah is associated with Abimelech, the son of Gideon, who ruled as a king over Israel for three years. After Abimelech's conflict with the people of Shechem, he lived in Arumah, possibly using it as a base of operations or a place of refuge. ¶The city is mentioned again in 2 Kings 23:36, where it is identified as the hometown of Zebidah, the mother of King Jehoiakim of Judah. Jehoiakim, who reigned in the early 6th century BC, was a vassal of Egypt and later Babylon. The mention of Rumah as his mother's place of origin suggests that the city may have been located in the northern kingdom of Israel or in the region of Samaria. ¶The exact location of Arumah or Rumah is uncertain, but some scholars propose that it could be identified with Khirbet el-Ormah, a site about 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Shechem. However, this identification remains tentative. ¶The biblical references to Arumah or Rumah, though brief, provide glimpses into the political and familial connections of significant figures in Israel's history, such as Abimelech and King Jehoiakim. The city's association with these individuals suggests its relative importance during their respective times.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Arvad, also known as Arwad or Arados, was an island city located off the coast of Syria, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Tripolis. It is mentioned in Ezekiel 27 as one of the cities that provided skilled mariners and soldiers for the maritime trade and defense of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city. ¶In Ezekiel's lamentation over Tyre, he describes the city's vast trading network and the various nations that contributed to its wealth and power. Arvad is noted for its role in supplying sailors to navigate Tyre's ships (Ezekiel 27:8) and soldiers to guard its walls (Ezekiel 27:11). This indicates that Arvad had a reputation for producing experienced seafarers and well-trained warriors. ¶Arvad was part of the Phoenician civilization and had a long history of maritime trade and cultural exchange with other Mediterranean nations. The city was situated on a small, rocky island with limited natural resources, which likely contributed to its focus on seafaring and commerce. ¶The biblical mention of Arvad in the context of Tyre's trade and military alliances highlights the interconnected nature of the Phoenician city-states and their shared expertise in navigation and maritime affairs. It also underscores the significance of Arvad as a valuable partner in Tyre's economic and defensive network. ¶Apart from its appearance in Ezekiel's prophecy, Arvad is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. However, its inclusion in this passage provides insight into the geopolitical and commercial landscape of the ancient Near East during the time of Ezekiel's ministry.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ashan was a city located in the Shephelah, or the lowlands, of Judah. It is mentioned in the Bible as part of the territorial allotments given to the tribes of Judah and Simeon after the conquest of Canaan. ¶In Joshua 15:42, Ashan is listed among the cities in the Shephelah region that were allocated to Judah. However, in Joshua 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32, Ashan is included in the list of cities given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance. ¶Later, in 1 Chronicles 6:59, Ashan is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, along with its pasturelands. This suggests that Ashan was designated as a Levitical city, where the priests and Levites resided and served in their sacred duties. ¶The exact location of Ashan is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be situated in the northwestern part of the Judean Shephelah, possibly near the city of Libnah. Some scholars propose identifying Ashan with the modern site of Khirbet Hasan, approximately 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Lachish. ¶The biblical references to Ashan highlight its inclusion in the territorial distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. Its assignment to both Judah and Simeon and its subsequent designation as a Levitical city underscore the complex process of land allocation and the provision for the Levites within the inherited territories.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ashkelon, one of the five principal Philistine cities, was captured by Judah but later became a symbol of judgment.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ashkelon was one of the five major cities of the Philistines, located along the Mediterranean coast, approximately 35 miles (56 km) south of Tel Aviv. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of conflict with Israel and as a target of prophetic judgment. ¶In Judges 1:18, Ashkelon is listed among the cities captured by the tribe of Judah during the conquest of Canaan. However, the city later reverted to Philistine control. Judges 14:19 records that Samson, empowered by the Spirit of the Lord, went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their garments to pay a debt. ¶Ashkelon is mentioned as one of the Philistine cities that received a golden tumor as a guilt offering when the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel (1 Samuel 6:17). In 2 Samuel 1:20, David laments the death of Saul and Jonathan, urging that the news not be proclaimed in Ashkelon, lest the Philistines rejoice. ¶Several prophets, including Jeremiah, Amos, and Zephaniah, pronounce judgments against Ashkelon. Jeremiah includes Ashkelon among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:20) and describes the city as cut off and bereaved (Jeremiah 47:5, 7). Amos prophesies that God will send fire upon Ashkelon (Amos 1:8), while Zephaniah declares that Ashkelon will become a desolation (Zephaniah 2:4) but also foresees a future restoration (Zephaniah 2:7). Zechariah portrays Ashkelon as fearful and mourning in the face of God's judgment (Zechariah 9:5). ¶Throughout its biblical history, Ashkelon remains a significant Philistine stronghold and a symbol of opposition to Israel. The city's inclusion in prophetic oracles underscores its importance and the divine judgment it would face for its hostility toward God's people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ashkenaz, a kingdom called to join the fight against Babylon in Jeremiah's prophecy.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ashkenaz is mentioned in Jeremiah 51:27 as one of the kingdoms summoned to battle against Babylon. In this prophetic oracle, Jeremiah declares that God will stir up the kings of the Medes, along with the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz, to destroy Babylon. ¶The exact location and identity of Ashkenaz are uncertain, but it is generally believed to be a region or people group associated with the Scythians, a nomadic Iranian people who inhabited the area north of the Black Sea. Some scholars propose that Ashkenaz may have been located in the vicinity of the Caspian Sea or in the region of Armenia. ¶The mention of Ashkenaz in Jeremiah's prophecy suggests that it was a significant power or ally that could contribute to the downfall of Babylon. By including Ashkenaz in the list of nations arrayed against Babylon, the prophet emphasizes the broad coalition that would bring about the city's destruction. ¶Apart from this single reference in Jeremiah, Ashkenaz is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Its inclusion in this prophetic context highlights the geopolitical dynamics of the ancient Near East and the role that various nations and kingdoms played in the unfolding of God's plan for judgment and redemption.</ext_description>

Both cities were located in the Shephelah, the lowland region situated between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. ¶The first Ashnah is listed in Joshua 15:33 among the cities in the northern part of the Shephelah, along with Eshtaol, Zorah, and others. This group of cities was located near the border with the tribe of Dan. ¶The second Ashnah is mentioned in Joshua 15:43, grouped with cities such as Jiphtah, Ashnah, and Nezib in the southern part of the Shephelah. This cluster of cities was situated closer to the Negev region. ¶Apart from their inclusion in the lists of Judah's cities, no other information is provided about either of the Ashnahs in the Bible. Their mention in the context of the tribal allotment highlights the process of dividing and assigning the conquered territories among the tribes of Israel. ¶The exact locations of the two Ashnahs are uncertain, and they are not mentioned in any other biblical narratives or historical accounts. Their presence in the lists of Judah's cities underscores the thoroughness and detail of the territorial descriptions in the book of Joshua.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ashtaroth or Beeshterah, a city in Bashan, ruled by King Og and later allotted to the Levites.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ashtaroth, also known as Beeshterah, was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in connection with Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled over the city. ¶In Deuteronomy 1:4, Ashtaroth is named as one of the cities defeated by the Israelites, along with Edrei, after they had conquered Sihon, king of the Amorites. Joshua 9:10 and 12:4 also mention Ashtaroth as part of the territory ruled by Og, who was one of the last remnants of the Rephaim, a race of giants. ¶After the conquest of Bashan, Ashtaroth was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Joshua 13:31). However, the city was later designated as a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Gershon (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This indicates that Ashtaroth was one of the cities set apart for the Levites to dwell in and perform their sacred duties. ¶In 1 Chronicles 11:44, Ashtaroth is mentioned as the hometown of Uzzia, one of David's mighty men, suggesting that the city had Israelite inhabitants during the time of David's reign. ¶The name Ashtaroth is also associated with the Canaanite goddess Astarte, and it is possible that the city was a center of her worship before the Israelite conquest. The biblical writers often used the name Ashtaroth to refer to the goddess herself or to the plural form of Astarte, representing multiple goddesses or idols. ¶The city of Ashtaroth was strategically located in the fertile region of Bashan, known for its rich pastures and livestock. Its mention in the Bible highlights the Israelites' victories over the powerful kings of the region and the allotment of the conquered territories to the tribes of Israel, including the Levites.</ext_description>

It is first mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities defeated by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies during the time of Abraham (Genesis 14:5). The name Ashteroth-karnaim likely means &quot;Ashteroth of the two horns,&quot; possibly referring to the goddess Astarte who was depicted with horns. The city was later part of the territory allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Joshua 13:29-31). The prophet Amos denounced the city, possibly indicating that it had become a center of idolatry (Amos 6:13). </ext_description>

		<short_description>Asia, a Roman province in western Asia Minor, with Ephesus as its capital.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Asia, as mentioned in the New Testament, refers to a Roman province that encompassed the western part of Asia Minor, with Ephesus as its capital. It should not be confused with the modern continent of Asia. ¶In Acts, Asia is mentioned several times in the context of Paul's missionary journeys. Jews from Asia were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9), and some belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen, who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). Paul traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia (Acts 16:6). Later, Paul spent two years in Ephesus, and all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord (Acts 19:10). Demetrius, a silversmith who made shrines of Artemis, stirred up a crowd against Paul, fearing that Paul's preaching would undermine the worship of Artemis, whom all Asia revered (Acts 19:26-27). ¶In his farewell address to the Ephesian elders, Paul mentions that he had faced plots by the Jews from Asia (Acts 20:18-19). When Paul visited the temple in Jerusalem, Jews from Asia stirred up the crowd against him (Acts 21:27). During Paul's voyage to Rome, the ship stopped at Myra in Lycia, where an Alexandrian ship was found sailing for Italy (Acts 27:2). ¶The churches in Asia are mentioned in the opening of 1 Peter (1 Peter 1:1) and Revelation (Revelation 1:4, 11). Paul also sends greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and to the church in their house, the first fruits of Asia (1 Corinthians 16:19; Romans 16:5). In 2 Timothy, Paul writes that all those in Asia had turned away from him (2 Timothy 1:15). ¶These references to Asia in the New Testament provide insight into the early spread of Christianity and the challenges faced by the apostles in this region of the Roman Empire.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Assos was a seaport located in the region of Mysia, in the western part of Asia Minor. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's third missionary journey. ¶According to Acts 20:13-14, Paul's companions sailed from Troas to Assos, while Paul himself traveled by land. The plan was for Paul to meet them in Assos and join them on the ship. After meeting up in Assos, they sailed together to Mitylene. ¶The reason for Paul's decision to travel by land to Assos is not explicitly stated in the text. Some scholars suggest that Paul may have wanted to visit friends or churches along the way, or that he needed time alone for prayer and reflection. ¶Assos was situated on the Aegean coast, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Troas. It was known for its strong walls, which were built from the local volcanic rock. The city also had a significant harbor and was an important trade center in the region. ¶Apart from this brief mention in Acts, Assos does not play a significant role in the New Testament narrative. However, its inclusion in the account of Paul's journey provides a glimpse into the geographical and maritime context of the apostle's travels and the early spread of Christianity in Asia Minor.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Assyria, a major Mesopotamian empire, frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as an adversary of Israel and Judah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Assyria, also known as Asshur, was a powerful ancient empire centered in Mesopotamia, in what is now modern-day Iraq. The Assyrians are mentioned extensively throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of their military conquests and their interactions with the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. ¶The name &quot;Asshur&quot; first appears in Genesis 10:11, where it is associated with Nimrod, who is said to have built several cities, including Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. In Genesis 25:18, the descendants of Ishmael are described as living in the region from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as one goes toward Assyria. ¶Assyria began to emerge as a significant power in the 9th century BC, and its kings are mentioned in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III is recorded as receiving tribute from Jehu, king of Israel (2 Kings 15:19-20). Later, Tiglath-Pileser III, also known as Pul, conquered parts of Israel and deported some of its inhabitants (2 Kings 15:29; 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26). ¶The Assyrian Empire reached its zenith during the reign of Sennacherib, who is known for his military campaigns against Judah and his siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18-19; 2 Chronicles 32; Isaiah 36-37). The prophet Isaiah played a significant role in encouraging Hezekiah to trust in God and resist the Assyrian threat. ¶Other Assyrian kings, such as Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, are also mentioned in the Bible (Ezra 4:2; 2 Chronicles 33:11). The fall of the Assyrian Empire is alluded to in the prophetic books, particularly in Nahum, which foretells the destruction of Nineveh (Nahum 3:18-19).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Atad was a threshing floor near the Jordan River where the Egyptians mourned Jacob's death.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Atad, also known as Abel-mizraim, was a threshing floor located east of the Jordan River. It was named in the Bible as the place where the funeral procession of Jacob, led by his son Joseph, stopped to mourn on their way from Egypt to Hebron (Genesis 50:10-11). The name Abel-mizraim means &quot;mourning of the Egyptians,&quot; referring to the seven-day period of lamentation observed by the Egyptians accompanying Joseph. The threshing floor of Atad was likely a prominent landmark in the region, suitable for a large gathering. Its location east of the Jordan suggests that it was in the territory later allotted to the tribes of Reuben or Gad. </ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ataroth was a town located on the border between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, as described in the book of Joshua. In Joshua 16:2, Ataroth is mentioned as part of the southern border of Ephraim, extending from Bethel to Ataroth. Later, in Joshua 16:7, Ataroth is listed among the towns marking the northern border of Ephraim, adjacent to the territory of Manasseh. ¶The exact location of Ataroth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of central Canaan, west of the Jordan River. Its mention in the boundary descriptions of Ephraim and Manasseh suggests that it was a significant landmark or settlement in the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of the Promised Land. ¶Apart from its inclusion in the territorial allotments of Ephraim and Manasseh, no other details about Ataroth are provided in the biblical text. Its primary significance lies in its role as a boundary marker, helping to delineate the extent of the tribal territories in the heartland of ancient Israel.</ext_description>

Moses granted their request on the condition that they help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan (Numbers 32:33-42). The town of Ataroth was rebuilt by the tribe of Gad (Numbers 32:34). Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the border between Gad and Reuben's territories. No other details are provided about the town's history, size, or importance.

		<ext_description>Ataroth-addar was a town situated on the border between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Benjamin, as recorded in the book of Joshua. In Joshua 16:5, Ataroth-addar is mentioned as part of the description of Ephraim's territory, specifically its southern border. The town is listed along with Beth-horon as marking the extent of Ephraim's inheritance. ¶In Joshua 18:13, Ataroth-addar appears again in the delineation of Benjamin's territory. The verse states that the border extended from there to Ataroth-addar, near the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. This description places Ataroth-addar in the vicinity of Beth-horon, a strategically important town in the western foothills of the central hill country. ¶The name Ataroth-addar likely combines two elements: &quot;Ataroth,&quot; meaning &quot;crowns&quot; or &quot;wreaths,&quot; and &quot;Addar,&quot; which may be a personal name or a descriptive term. The exact location of Ataroth-addar is not known with certainty, but its repeated mention in the boundary descriptions underscores its significance as a border town between Ephraim and Benjamin. ¶Apart from its role in demarcating tribal territories, no other information about Ataroth-addar is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary lists of Joshua highlights the importance of establishing clear territorial divisions among the tribes of Israel as they settled in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Athach is mentioned briefly in 1 Samuel 30:30 as one of the towns in Judah that received a portion of the spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites. After rescuing his men's families and recovering all that the Amalekites had taken, David sent gifts from the plunder to the elders of Judah and to his friends in various towns, including Athach. ¶The exact location of Athach is unknown, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah, possibly in the Negev region. The context of 1 Samuel 30 suggests that Athach was among the towns where David had previously found support and refuge during his time fleeing from King Saul. ¶David's act of sharing the spoils with Athach and other towns demonstrates his gratitude for their assistance and his desire to strengthen his relationships with the people of Judah. This gesture also foreshadows David's future role as king over all Israel, as he sought to build alliances and establish his authority in the region. ¶Apart from this single reference in 1 Samuel, no other information about Athach is provided in the Bible. Its mention in the context of David's victory and distribution of plunder highlights the significance of his growing influence and the support he enjoyed among the towns of Judah.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Atharim is mentioned in Numbers 21:1 as the place where the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites were coming along the road to Atharim. Upon hearing this news, the king attacked Israel and took some of them captive. ¶The exact location of Atharim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of the Negev desert, south of Canaan. The name Atharim may refer to a specific road or route that the Israelites were traveling on during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. ¶The incident at Atharim occurred after the Israelites had left Mount Hor and were continuing their journey around the land of Edom. The attack by the Canaanite king of Arad was a significant challenge for the Israelites, as it threatened their progress and security in the region. ¶In response to this attack, the Israelites made a vow to the Lord, promising to utterly destroy the Canaanite cities if God would deliver them into their hands. God heard their plea and gave them victory over the Canaanites, leading to the destruction of their cities and the renaming of the place as Hormah, meaning &quot;destruction&quot; (Numbers 21:2-3). ¶The event at Atharim highlights the ongoing challenges and conflicts the Israelites faced during their wilderness journey, as well as their dependence on God's protection and intervention in the face of enemy attacks. It also foreshadows the future conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Athens, the intellectual and cultural center of ancient Greece, where Paul preached the gospel and addressed the Areopagus.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Athens was a prominent city in ancient Greece, known for its rich history, cultural achievements, and philosophical traditions. In the New Testament, Athens is mentioned primarily in connection with the Apostle Paul's second missionary journey. ¶According to Acts 17:15-16, Paul was brought to Athens by some believers from Berea, who then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. While waiting for them in Athens, Paul was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols. ¶Paul's time in Athens was marked by his interactions with the local philosophers and his famous sermon at the Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill (Acts 17:19-34). He engaged in discussions with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, who were intrigued by his teaching about Jesus and the resurrection. Some of them brought Paul to the Areopagus, where he delivered a discourse, starting with a reference to an altar dedicated to an unknown god. ¶In his sermon, Paul proclaimed the one true God, the Creator of all things, and called for repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris. ¶After his time in Athens, Paul traveled to Corinth (Acts 18:1), where he continued his ministry. Later, in his letters to the Thessalonians, Paul mentioned sending Timothy to them from Athens to strengthen and encourage them in their faith (1 Thessalonians 3:1-2).</ext_description>

In this passage, God declares judgment upon Damascus and states that He &quot;will break the gate bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven.&quot; The exact location of the Aven Valley is uncertain, but it was likely a fertile plain near Damascus. The name &quot;Aven&quot; means &quot;wickedness&quot; or &quot;idolatry,&quot; possibly indicating that the valley was known for its idolatrous practices.

		<ext_description>Azekah was a town in the Shephelah region of Judah, located about 17 miles southwest of Jerusalem. It is first mentioned in Joshua 10:10-11, where the Amorite kings were defeated by Joshua and the Israelites. Azekah was later listed as one of the cities in the allotment of the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:35). The Philistines gathered their armies between Socoh and Azekah before the famous battle between David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17:1). During the reign of King Rehoboam, Azekah was one of the cities fortified for the defense of Judah (2 Chronicles 11:9). After the Babylonian exile, Azekah was reinhabited by the Jews (Nehemiah 11:30). The city was one of the last two strongholds, along with Lachish, to fall to the Babylonians during the siege of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 34:7). Archaeological excavations at the site of Tel Azekah have revealed evidence of the city's occupation from the Bronze Age through the Babylonian destruction.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Baal-hazor is mentioned in 2 Samuel 13:23 as the location where Absalom, King David's son, had his sheepshearers. Absalom invited all the king's sons to join him at Baal-hazor for a feast. It was during this gathering that Absalom orchestrated the murder of his half-brother Amnon in revenge for Amnon's rape of Absalom's sister Tamar. The exact location of Baal-hazor is not specified, but it was likely situated near Ephraim, as the verse mentions that it was &quot;beside Ephraim.&quot; </ext_description>

		<short_description>Baal-meon (Beth-baal-meon, Beth-meon, or Beon) was a Moabite town, allotted to Reuben, but later retaken by Moab. (Numbers 32:38; 1 Chronicles 5:8; Ezekiel 25:9; Joshua 13:17; Jeremiah 48:23; Numbers 32:3)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Baal-meon, also known as Beth-baal-meon, Beth-meon, or Beon, was a town originally inhabited by the Moabites. During the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the town was allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Numbers 32:38; Joshua 13:17). The Reubenites rebuilt the city and renamed it, possibly to remove its association with the Canaanite deity Baal (Numbers 32:38). However, the town later reverted to Moabite control, as evidenced by its mention in the prophecies against Moab (Jeremiah 48:23; Ezekiel 25:9). The town was located in the territory of the Moabites, east of the Dead Sea (Numbers 32:3). Baal-meon was likely situated near the border between Moab and Reuben's territory, as it was mentioned in the context of the Reubenite settlements (1 Chronicles 5:8).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Baal-perazim was the place where David defeated the Philistines. (2 Samuel 5:20; 1 Chronicles 14:11)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Baal-perazim is mentioned in 2 Samuel 5:20 and 1 Chronicles 14:11 as the location where King David decisively defeated the Philistines after becoming king over all Israel. The Philistines had come up to challenge David's rule, spreading out in the Valley of Rephaim. David inquired of the Lord and was told to attack the Philistines, which he did successfully, resulting in their defeat. David attributed the victory to God, saying, &quot;The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.&quot; As a result, he named the place Baal-perazim, which means &quot;Lord of Breakthroughs.&quot; The exact location of Baal-perazim is not specified, but it was likely situated in the Valley of Rephaim, southwest of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Baal-shalishah is mentioned in 2 Kings 4:42 as the hometown of a man who brought provisions to the prophet Elisha during a time of famine. The man brought twenty loaves of barley bread and some heads of new grain to Elisha at Gilgal.

The exact location of Baal-shalishah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Ephraim, as Gilgal was located in that area. </ext_description>

		<ext_description>Baal-zephon is mentioned in Exodus 14:2, 9, and Numbers 33:7 as a place near where the Israelites camped before crossing the Red Sea during their exodus from Egypt. God instructed Moses to have the people turn back and camp near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal-zephon (Exodus 14:2). The Egyptians caught up with the Israelites as they were camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon (Exodus 14:9). The exact location of Baal-zephon is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, near the northern tip of the Red Sea. The name &quot;Baal-zephon&quot; means &quot;Lord of the North&quot; or &quot;Baal of the North,&quot; possibly referring to a local deity worshipped by the Egyptians in that area.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Babylon, also known as Babel, Sheshak, Merathaim, or Pekod, was an ancient Mesopotamian city that served as the capital of the Babylonian Empire. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Babylon, also known as Babel, was an ancient city located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) along the Euphrates River. It served as the capital of the Babylonian Empire, one of the most powerful empires in the ancient Near East. The city first appears in the Bible in Genesis 10:10 as part of Nimrod's kingdom and is identified as the location of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:9). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Babylon is mentioned as a major political and military power, often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The city became the dominant power in the region under King Nebuchadnezzar II, who conquered Judah, destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, and exiled many Jews to Babylon (2 Kings 24-25; 2 Chronicles 36). The Babylonian captivity lasted for 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:11; 29:10). ¶Several Old Testament prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, prophesied against Babylon, foretelling its eventual downfall (Isaiah 13-14; Jeremiah 50-51; Ezekiel 26-32). In these prophecies, Babylon is sometimes referred to by other names, such as Sheshak (Jeremiah 25:26; 51:41), Merathaim (Jeremiah 50:21), and Pekod (Jeremiah 50:21; Ezekiel 23:23), which are believed to be code names or references to specific regions within the Babylonian Empire. ¶After the Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC, the city gradually declined in importance. In the New Testament, Babylon is used symbolically to represent worldly power and opposition to God (Revelation 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bahurim (or Baharum) was a village near Jerusalem, known as the home of Shimei, who cursed David. (2 Samuel 3:16; 16:5; 17:18; 19:16; 1 Kings 2:8; 2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bahurim, also spelled Baharum, was a village located near Jerusalem, likely within the territory of Benjamin. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, primarily in connection with events during the reign of King David. ¶In 2 Samuel 3:16, Bahurim is mentioned as the place where Michal, David's wife, was returned to him by her husband Paltiel, as ordered by David. Later, when David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei, a member of Saul's clan from Bahurim, cursed and threw stones at David and his men (2 Samuel 16:5). However, when David returned to Jerusalem after Absalom's defeat, Shimei met him at the Jordan River and apologized for his actions (2 Samuel 19:16; 1 Kings 2:8). ¶Bahurim is also mentioned as the hometown of Azmaveth, one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33). Additionally, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the sons of the priests Abiathar and Zadok, hid in a well at Bahurim to avoid being captured by Absalom's men while relaying information to David (2 Samuel 17:18).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bajith (or &quot;temple&quot;) was a Moabite temple or high place mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy against Moab. (Isaiah 15:2)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bajith, meaning &quot;temple&quot; or &quot;house,&quot; is mentioned in Isaiah 15:2 as part of a prophecy against Moab. In this passage, Isaiah describes the Moabites going up to their temple (Bajith) and to their high places to weep and mourn over the impending destruction of their cities, Nebo and Medeba. ¶The specific location of Bajith is not provided, but it is likely that it was a significant temple or high place within Moabite territory, east of the Dead Sea. High places were elevated locations where pagan worship and sacrifices were often conducted. ¶The prophecy in Isaiah 15 foretells the judgment and devastation that would come upon Moab, a nation that had a history of conflict with Israel. The mention of the Moabites going to Bajith to weep and mourn highlights their distress and the futility of seeking help from their pagan gods in the face of God's judgment.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Bamoth-baal, meaning &quot;high places of Baal,&quot; was a Moabite place of worship mentioned in Numbers 22:41. It was one of the locations where Balak, the king of Moab, took the prophet Balaam to curse the Israelites as they were passing through the region. From Bamoth-baal, Balaam could see a portion of the Israelite camp. The place was likely situated on an elevated location, as its name suggests, and was associated with the worship of the Canaanite deity Baal. In Joshua 13:17, Bamoth-baal is listed as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Reuben in the territory east of the Jordan River. Numbers 21:28 also mentions Bamoth-baal in the context of the Amorite conquest of Moab before the Israelites arrived in the area.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Bashan was a region located east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land, lush pastures, and abundant livestock. It was conquered by the Israelites during the time of Moses, along with the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan (Numbers 21:33; Deuteronomy 3:1-11). The land of Bashan was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Numbers 32:33; Joshua 13:29-31). ¶The region was known for its strong oak trees (Isaiah 2:13; Ezekiel 27:6) and its well-nourished cattle, often referred to as the &quot;bulls of Bashan&quot; (Deuteronomy 32:14; Psalm 22:12; Amos 4:1). It was also famous for its rich pastures (Jeremiah 50:19; Micah 7:14) and its fertile soil, which was well-suited for growing crops (Psalm 135:11; 136:20). ¶Bashan was one of the regions from which Solomon received supplies for his royal court (1 Kings 4:13). It was also the homeland of Golan, one of the cities of refuge designated by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8; 21:27). ¶Several Old Testament passages use Bashan as a symbol of God's power and judgment (Psalm 68:15, 22; Isaiah 33:9; Jeremiah 22:20; Ezekiel 39:18; Zechariah 11:2). The region was also mentioned in the context of God's blessings and provision for His people (Deuteronomy 33:22; Nehemiah 9:22).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Bath-rabbim, meaning &quot;daughter of many,&quot; is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Song of Solomon 7:4. In this verse, the Beloved's eyes are compared to the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, which was later allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Numbers 21:26; Joshua 13:17). ¶The gate of Bath-rabbim was likely one of the main gates of Heshbon, possibly named for its location near a busy area or a place where many people gathered. The pools of Heshbon mentioned in the verse were probably nearby reservoirs or water sources. ¶In the Song of Solomon, the comparison of the Beloved's eyes to these pools suggests that they were clear, peaceful, and beautiful. The gate of Bath-rabbim serves as a poetic reference to emphasize the beauty and serenity of the Beloved's eyes.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Beautiful Gate was a gate of the Jerusalem temple, where Peter healed a lame man. (Acts 3:2, 10)</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Beautiful Gate, mentioned in Acts 3:2 and 3:10, was one of the gates of the temple in Jerusalem during the time of the early church. It was the location where the apostle Peter, accompanied by John, encountered a man who had been lame from birth. The man was carried daily to the gate to ask for alms from those entering the temple courts. ¶As Peter and John approached the gate, the man asked them for money. Instead, Peter commanded the man to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Instantly, the man's feet and ankles were made strong, and he began to walk, leap, and praise God. This miracle attracted the attention of the people, who were astonished to see the man walking and praising God. ¶The exact location and appearance of the Beautiful Gate are not described in detail in the Bible. It is believed to have been one of the main entrances to the temple complex, possibly leading from the Court of the Gentiles to the Court of Women. The gate's name suggests that it was likely an ornate and impressive structure. ¶The healing of the lame man at the Beautiful Gate was a significant event in the early church, demonstrating the power of the risen Christ and the authority of the apostles to perform miracles in His name. It also provided an opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel to the gathered crowd, resulting in many people coming to believe in Jesus (Acts 3:11-26).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beer was a site where God provided water for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. (Numbers 21:16)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beer, meaning &quot;well&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned in Numbers 21:16 as a place where God instructed Moses to gather the people, and He would provide water for them. This event occurred during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. ¶The Israelites had been complaining about the lack of water, and God responded by directing Moses to assemble the people at Beer. There, God provided water for them, demonstrating His provision and care for His people in the desert. ¶The exact location of Beer is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely somewhere in the region of Moab, east of the Jordan River, as the Israelites were traveling through that area at the time. </ext_description>

		<short_description>Beer-elim was a place mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy against Moab. (Isaiah 15:8)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beer-elim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Isaiah 15:8, as part of a prophecy against Moab. The name &quot;Beer-elim&quot; means &quot;well of the mighty ones&quot; or &quot;well of the terebinths&quot; in Hebrew. ¶In the prophecy, Isaiah describes the destruction and mourning that would come upon Moab, a nation located east of the Dead Sea. The passage states that &quot;the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab; its wailing reaches to Eglaim, its wailing reaches to Beer-elim.&quot; ¶The exact location of Beer-elim is not specified in the Bible, but based on the context of the prophecy, it was likely a place within the territory of Moab. The mention of Beer-elim alongside Eglaim suggests that it may have been a significant town or landmark in the region. ¶The prophecy against Moab in Isaiah 15 is part of a larger series of oracles against various nations, highlighting God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people. The reference to Beer-elim serves to emphasize the widespread nature of Moab's distress and the extent of the impending destruction.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beer-lahai-roi was a well where Hagar encountered the Angel of the Lord, between Kadesh and Bered. (Genesis 16:14, 24:62, 25:11)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beer-lahai-roi, meaning &quot;well of the Living One who sees me,&quot; was a well located between Kadesh and Bered in the Negev region. It is mentioned three times in the book of Genesis, all in connection with Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant. ¶In Genesis 16, Hagar fled from Sarah after being mistreated. As she was wandering in the wilderness, the Angel of the Lord appeared to her near a spring of water. The Angel spoke to Hagar, encouraging her and instructing her to return to Sarah and submit to her. Hagar responded by calling the name of the Lord &quot;You are the God who sees,&quot; and she named the well Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 16:14). ¶Later, in Genesis 24:62, it is mentioned that Isaac, Abraham's son, was living in the Negev and had come from Beer-lahai-roi when Rebekah arrived to become his wife. After Abraham's death, Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 25:11). ¶The well of Beer-lahai-roi served as a significant location in the story of Hagar and her encounters with God. It represented a place of divine revelation, provision, and comfort for Hagar during her time of distress. The name of the well itself testifies to Hagar's recognition of God's presence and His care for her in the wilderness.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beeroth (or Beer) was a Hivite city that later became part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin. (Joshua 9:17, 18:25; 2 Samuel 4:2-3, 5, 9; 23:37; Nehemiah 7:29; Ezra 2:25; 1 Chronicles 11:39; Judges 9:21)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beeroth, also known as Beer, was a city originally inhabited by the Hivites, one of the Canaanite tribes. During the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the people of Beeroth, along with those of Gibeon, Chephirah, and Kiriath-jearim, deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land (Joshua 9:17). ¶After the treaty was made, Beeroth was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Joshua 18:25). The city was located in the region north of Jerusalem, near Gibeon and Kiriath-jearim. ¶Beeroth is mentioned in connection with several events in the Bible. It was the hometown of two of David's mighty men, Naharai (2 Samuel 23:37; 1 Chronicles 11:39) and Rechab and Baanah, who murdered Ish-bosheth, Saul's son (2 Samuel 4:2-3, 5, 9). After the Babylonian exile, some of the people of Beeroth returned to Judah (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). ¶In Judges 9:21, Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, fled to Beer (possibly another name for Beeroth) for safety after confronting the people of Shechem about their support for his half-brother Abimelech, who had killed Jotham's brothers. ¶The city of Beeroth played a role in the early history of Israel, first as a Canaanite city that deceived the Israelites, then as part of the tribe of Benjamin's inheritance, and later as the hometown of some of David's mighty men and a place of refuge for Jotham.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beersheba (Sheba or Shibah) was an important city in southern Israel, associated with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beersheba, also known as Sheba or Shibah, was a significant city located in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. ¶The name &quot;Beersheba&quot; first appears in Genesis 21:31, where Abraham named the place after making a covenant with Abimelech, the king of Gerar. The name means &quot;well of seven&quot; or &quot;well of the oath,&quot; referring to the seven ewe lambs that Abraham gave to Abimelech as a witness to the covenant (Genesis 21:28-31). ¶Abraham lived in Beersheba for a time (Genesis 22:19), and it was from there that he set out to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice in the land of Moriah (Genesis 22:1-19). Isaac also lived in Beersheba, where he built an altar and called upon the name of the Lord (Genesis 26:23-25, 33). Jacob left Beersheba to go to Haran (Genesis 28:10) and later returned there to offer sacrifices to God before going to Egypt (Genesis 46:1, 5). ¶In the later history of Israel, Beersheba marked the southern extent of the nation, as seen in the phrase &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot; (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20; 2 Samuel 3:10; 17:11; 24:2, 15; 1 Kings 4:25). The city was allotted to the tribe of Simeon (Joshua 19:2) and became part of the kingdom of Judah (2 Samuel 24:7). ¶Beersheba was also a center of idolatry, as evidenced by the references to the &quot;way of Beersheba&quot; (Amos 8:14) and the &quot;sin of Samaria&quot; (Amos 5:5). King Josiah removed the idolatrous priests and destroyed the high places from Geba to Beersheba as part of his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:8). ¶In summary, Beersheba was a prominent city in the Negev, serving as a key location in the lives of the patriarchs and later as a boundary marker for the nation of Israel. Its history was marked by both faithfulness to God and idolatry.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bene-jaakan (Beeroth Bene-jaakan) was an Israelite encampment during the wilderness wanderings. (Numbers 33:31-32; Deuteronomy 10:6)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bene-jaakan, also known as Beeroth Bene-jaakan, was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. The name &quot;Bene-jaakan&quot; means &quot;sons of Jaakan&quot; in Hebrew, while &quot;Beeroth Bene-jaakan&quot; means &quot;wells of the sons of Jaakan.&quot; ¶In Numbers 33:31-32, Bene-jaakan is listed as one of the stages in the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. The passage states that they traveled from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan, and then they journeyed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. ¶In Deuteronomy 10:6, Beeroth Bene-jaakan is mentioned in the context of Moses' recounting of the Israelites' travels. It states that the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried. ¶The exact location of Bene-jaakan or Beeroth Bene-jaakan is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated somewhere in the Sinai Peninsula or the Negev desert. The mention of wells in the name suggests that it may have been a place with a reliable water source, which would have been important during the Israelites' desert wanderings.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Benjamin Gate was a gate in Jerusalem, associated with the tribe of Benjamin. (Jeremiah 20:2, 37:13, 38:7)</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Benjamin Gate, mentioned in the book of Jeremiah, was one of the gates of Jerusalem during the time of the prophets. It was likely named after the tribe of Benjamin, whose territory was located just north of the city. ¶In Jeremiah 20:2, the priest Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah and put him in the stocks at the Benjamin Gate. This incident occurred after Jeremiah had prophesied about the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of its people. ¶Later, in Jeremiah 37:13, the prophet was arrested by the guard at the Benjamin Gate when he was attempting to leave Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege of the city. The guard accused Jeremiah of defecting to the Babylonians, but the prophet denied the charge. ¶In Jeremiah 38:7, Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, heard that Jeremiah had been put into a cistern in the court of the guard. He went to the king at the Benjamin Gate to intercede on Jeremiah's behalf, and the king ordered Ebed-melech to take men and lift Jeremiah out of the cistern. ¶The Benjamin Gate served as a significant location in the book of Jeremiah, being associated with the prophet's persecution, arrest, and rescue. Its mention in these passages highlights the political and religious tensions in Jerusalem during the time leading up to the Babylonian exile.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Benjamin Gate was a gate in Jerusalem's wall, mentioned in Zechariah's prophecy about the city's restoration. (Zechariah 14:10)</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Benjamin Gate is mentioned in Zechariah 14:10 as part of a prophecy concerning the future restoration and transformation of Jerusalem. In this passage, the prophet describes a time when Jerusalem will be safely inhabited and the surrounding land will be turned into a plain. ¶The verse states that the city will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses. This description suggests that the Benjamin Gate was one of the key landmarks in Jerusalem's wall, possibly located on the northern side of the city, facing the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. ¶The prophecy in Zechariah 14 speaks of a future time when Jerusalem will be exalted and secure, with the Lord being king over all the earth. The mention of the Benjamin Gate in this context highlights its significance as part of the restored and transformed city. ¶It is worth noting that the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Zechariah may not necessarily be the same gate as the one referenced in the book of Jeremiah, as the two prophets lived at different times in history. However, both gates were likely named after the tribe of Benjamin and were important landmarks in Jerusalem's topography.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Beracah Valley, meaning &quot;Valley of Blessing,&quot; is mentioned in 2 Chronicles 20:26 in connection with King Jehoshaphat of Judah and his army. After the Lord had given them a miraculous victory over the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites, they assembled in the valley on the fourth day to praise and bless the Lord for His deliverance. As a result, they named the place &quot;Beracah Valley.&quot; The exact location of the valley is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated somewhere between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, in the vicinity of the battle. The Beracah Valley stands as a testament to God's faithfulness and the importance of acknowledging His hand in the victories of His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Berea was a city in Macedonia where Paul preached, and the home of Sopater, one of Paul's traveling companions. (Acts 17:10, 13; 20:4)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Berea, also known as Beroea, was a city in Macedonia, located southwest of Thessalonica. It is mentioned in the book of Acts as one of the places where Paul and Silas preached the gospel during Paul's second missionary journey. After being forced to leave Thessalonica due to opposition from the Jews, Paul and Silas went to Berea (Acts 17:10). The Bereans were commended for their open-mindedness and diligence in examining the Scriptures daily to verify the truth of Paul's message (Acts 17:11). Many of the Bereans believed, including prominent Greek women and men. However, when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching in Berea, they came and stirred up trouble, forcing Paul to leave the city (Acts 17:13-14). Sopater, a believer from Berea, later accompanied Paul on his return trip to Asia (Acts 20:4). The church in Berea stands as an example of a community that eagerly received the word of God and diligently studied the Scriptures.</ext_description>

The Angel encouraged Hagar and instructed her to return to Sarah and submit to her authority. Hagar called the name of the Lord &quot;You are the God who sees,&quot; and the well was named Beer-lahai-roi, meaning &quot;the well of the Living One who sees me.&quot; The verse states that this well was located between Kadesh and Bered. The exact location of Bered is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Canaan. </ext_description>

		<ext_description>Berothah, also known as Berothai or Cun, is mentioned in both Ezekiel's prophetic vision and in the historical accounts of King David's reign. In Ezekiel 47:16, the city is described as one of the landmarks defining the northern border of Israel in the future division of the land. The verse places Berothah between the territories of Hamath and Damascus. In 2 Samuel 8:8 and 1 Chronicles 18:8, Berothai is mentioned as one of the cities from which King David took a large amount of bronze after defeating Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. The city is called Cun in 1 Chronicles 18:8, which may be an alternative name or a scribal variation. The exact location of Berothah/Berothai/Cun is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Zobah, a kingdom to the north of Israel. The city's mention in both prophetic and historical contexts suggests that it was a significant place during the time of the Old Testament.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Besor was a brook where David's men pursued the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag. (1 Samuel 30:9, 10, 21)</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Besor is a brook mentioned in 1 Samuel 30 in connection with David's pursuit of the Amalekites. After the Amalekites had raided Ziklag and taken captive the families of David and his men, David sought the Lord's guidance and was directed to pursue the raiders. As they came to the Brook Besor, two hundred of David's men were too exhausted to continue the pursuit and remained behind (1 Samuel 30:9-10). David and the remaining four hundred men crossed the brook and eventually overtook the Amalekites, defeating them and recovering all that had been taken, including their families. On their return, they met the two hundred men who had stayed at the Brook Besor, and David insisted that they share equally in the spoils of victory (1 Samuel 30:21-25). The exact location of the Brook Besor is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Ziklag. The brook played a significant role in David's successful pursuit and defeat of the Amalekites.</ext_description>

This failure to completely conquer and occupy the town was part of a larger pattern of the Israelites' incomplete obedience to God's command to drive out the Canaanites from the land.

		<short_description>Bethany was a village near Jerusalem, known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, where Jesus often visited and performed miracles. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethany was a village located about two miles east of Jerusalem, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. It is mentioned frequently in the Gospels, particularly in connection with Jesus' ministry and the family of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, who were close friends of Jesus. ¶Jesus often visited Bethany and stayed with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (Luke 10:38-42; John 12:1-3). It was in Bethany that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, performing one of His most significant miracles (John 11:1-44). This event took place shortly before Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12:1, 9-11). ¶Bethany was also the place where Jesus was anointed by Mary, who poured expensive perfume on His feet and wiped them with her hair (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). This act of devotion took place in the house of Simon the leper, and it was criticized by Judas Iscariot as a waste of money. ¶In the Synoptic Gospels, Bethany is mentioned in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1, 17; Mark 11:1, 11-12; Luke 19:29). Jesus sent two of His disciples to Bethany to find a colt for Him to ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶After His resurrection, Jesus led His disciples out as far as Bethany before ascending into heaven (Luke 24:50-51). The village held a special place in Jesus' ministry, serving as a place of rest, friendship, and significant events. ¶In John 1:28, a different Bethany is mentioned, which is specified as &quot;Bethany beyond the Jordan.&quot; This Bethany was located on the eastern side of the Jordan River, where John the Baptist was baptizing people. It should not be confused with the Bethany near Jerusalem.</ext_description>

However, in Joshua 18:18 and 18:22, Beth-arabah is mentioned as a town in the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin. ¶The exact location of Beth-arabah is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Judean Desert, near the Dead Sea. The wilderness of Beth-arabah was one of the regions where the cities of Judah were located (Joshua 15:61). ¶The term &quot;Arbathite&quot; is used to describe Abi-albon, one of David's mighty men, in 2 Samuel 23:31 and 1 Chronicles 11:32. The name suggests that Abi-albon was from Beth-arabah or had some connection to the town or region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-arbel was a place destroyed by Shalman, mentioned in Hosea's prophecy as an example of destruction. (Hosea 10:14)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-arbel is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Hosea 10:14, as part of a prophecy against Israel. In this verse, the prophet Hosea warns that the fortresses of Israel will be destroyed, just as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. ¶The exact location of Beth-arbel is uncertain, and the identity of Shalman is also a matter of debate. Some scholars believe that Beth-arbel may refer to the city of Arbela, located in the region of Galilee, which was known for its fortified caves. Others suggest that it might be a reference to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III or Shalmaneser V, who were involved in campaigns against Israel and Judah. ¶The destruction of Beth-arbel is used by Hosea as an example of the impending judgment that would come upon Israel because of their unfaithfulness to God. The vivid description of the city's destruction, with mothers and children being killed, emphasizes the severity of the coming judgment.</ext_description>

The name Beth-ashbea means &quot;house of Ashbea&quot; or &quot;house of the oath&quot; in Hebrew. ¶The mention of the families of the house of Ashbea and their fine linen work suggests that Beth-ashbea was known for its textile industry. Fine linen was a valuable commodity in ancient times, often used for clothing, bedding, and religious garments. ¶No other details about Beth-ashbea or the families of the house of Ashbea are provided in the Bible.

		<short_description>Beth-Ashtoreth was a Philistine city where Saul's armor was put in the temple of Ashtoreth after his death. (1 Samuel 31:10)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-Ashtoreth, meaning &quot;house of Ashtoreth&quot; in Hebrew, was a Philistine city mentioned in 1 Samuel 31:10. After King Saul's death in the battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa, the Philistines found his body and cut off his head. They then sent messengers throughout their land to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among the people. ¶As part of this victory celebration, the Philistines put Saul's armor in the temple of Ashtoreth at Beth-Ashtoreth. Ashtoreth, also known as Astarte, was a Canaanite goddess of love, fertility, and war, often associated with the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and the Greek goddess Aphrodite. ¶The exact location of Beth-Ashtoreth is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely a significant Philistine city with a prominent temple dedicated to Ashtoreth. The placement of Saul's armor in the temple was a way for the Philistines to celebrate their victory over Israel and to attribute their success to their goddess. ¶The event also highlights the tragic end of Saul's reign and the humiliation that befell him and Israel as a result of their defeat at the hands of the Philistines. In contrast, 1 Chronicles 10:10 mentions that Saul's head was put in the temple of Dagon, another Philistine deity, showing the widespread celebration of the Philistine victory.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-aven was a town and wilderness near Ai and Bethel, associated with idolatry and Israel's defeat. (Joshua 7:2; 18:12; 1 Samuel 13:5; 14:23; Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-aven, meaning &quot;house of wickedness&quot; or &quot;house of idolatry&quot; in Hebrew, was a town and wilderness area mentioned in the Old Testament. In Joshua 7:2, Beth-aven is described as being east of Bethel and near the city of Ai. Spies were sent from Joshua's camp at Gilgal to Ai, and they reported that the city was small and could be easily defeated. However, when the Israelites attacked Ai, they were defeated because of the sin of Achan (Joshua 7:3-5). ¶In Joshua 18:12, Beth-aven is mentioned as part of the northern border of the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin, near Bethel. Later, in 1 Samuel 13:5, the Philistines gathered their forces at Michmash, east of Beth-aven, in preparation for battle against Israel. During this conflict, Saul's son Jonathan and his armor-bearer initiated an attack on the Philistine garrison, which led to a great victory for Israel (1 Samuel 14:1-23). ¶The prophets Hosea and Amos used Beth-aven as a derogatory term for Bethel, which had become a center of idolatry in Israel (Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5). Hosea warned the people not to go to Gilgal or Beth-aven, and Amos denounced the idolatrous practices at Bethel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-azmaveth (Azmaveth) was a town in Benjamin, home to some who returned from the Babylonian exile. (Nehemiah 7:28; Ezra 2:24; Nehemiah 12:29)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-azmaveth, also known as Azmaveth, was a town in the territory of Benjamin mentioned in the context of the return from the Babylonian exile. In Ezra 2:24 and Nehemiah 7:28, the people of Beth-azmaveth are listed among those who returned to Judah with Zerubbabel. ¶The name Beth-azmaveth means &quot;house of Azmaveth&quot; or &quot;house of the strong one of death&quot; in Hebrew. Azmaveth was also the name of one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33), but it is unclear if there is any connection between the town and the individual. ¶In Nehemiah 12:29, Beth-azmaveth is mentioned again as one of the places where the Levites settled after returning from exile. The Levites were responsible for serving in the temple and assisting the priests in their duties. ¶The exact location of Beth-azmaveth is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated within the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. The town's mention in the context of the return from exile suggests that it was resettled by the Israelites who came back to their homeland after the Babylonian captivity.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-barah (Bethabara) was a place where Gideon stationed men to intercept the fleeing Midianites, and where John the Baptist baptized. (Judges 7:24; John 1:28)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-barah, also known as Bethabara, is mentioned in two different contexts in the Bible. In Judges 7:24, during Gideon's battle against the Midianites, he sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, asking the Ephraimites to intercept the fleeing Midianites at the waters of Beth-barah and the Jordan. The Ephraimites captured and killed the two Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb. ¶In John 1:28, Bethabara is mentioned as the place where John the Baptist was baptizing people. This Bethabara is described as being &quot;beyond the Jordan,&quot; indicating that it was on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Some manuscripts mention &quot;Bethany&quot; instead of &quot;Bethabara&quot; in this verse, which has led to some confusion. However, the Bethany mentioned here is not the same as the village near Jerusalem associated with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. ¶The exact location of Beth-barah/Bethabara is uncertain, but it was likely a ford or crossing point along the Jordan River, possibly in the vicinity of the Jabbok River. The name Beth-barah means &quot;house of the crossing&quot; or &quot;house of the ford&quot; in Hebrew, which supports this interpretation.</ext_description>

The verse states that Beth-biri, along with several other towns, belonged to Simeon until the reign of David. ¶The name Beth-biri means &quot;house of my creation&quot; or &quot;house of my pasture&quot; in Hebrew. In the parallel list of Simeon's towns found in Joshua 19:4, the name Bethul appears instead of Beth-biri. This suggests that Beth-biri may have been an alternate name for Bethul or that the town's name changed over time. ¶The exact location of Beth-biri is not specified in the Bible, but it was within the territory of Simeon, which was located in the southern part of Canaan, within the larger allotment of the tribe of Judah. Simeon's territory was eventually absorbed into Judah, as the tribe's population decreased over time. ¶</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-car is mentioned only once in the Bible, in 1 Samuel 7:11, in the context of the Israelites' victory over the Philistines. After the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel by the Philistines, Samuel led the people in a ceremony of repentance and dedication to the Lord at Mizpah. ¶When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, they decided to attack. However, as the Philistines approached, the Lord sent a loud thunder upon them, causing confusion and panic in their ranks. The Israelites then pursued the Philistines and struck them down from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car. ¶The name Beth-car means &quot;house of the lamb&quot; or &quot;house of pasture&quot; in Hebrew. The exact location of Beth-car is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, west of Mizpah, in the direction of the Philistine cities. ¶The victory at Beth-car was significant for the Israelites, as it marked the beginning of a period of peace and the end of Philistine oppression during Samuel's leadership. The pursuit of the Philistines to Beth-car demonstrates the Israelites' renewed confidence and trust in the Lord's protection and guidance.</ext_description>

The prophet Amos, in his prophecy against Damascus (the capital of Aram or Syria), declares that the Lord will break the gate bars of Damascus and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden. ¶The exact location of Beth-eden is not specified in the Bible, but it is associated with the rulers of Aram. The context suggests that it may have been a royal residence or a place of importance for the Aramean kings. ¶The reference to the &quot;one who holds the scepter&quot; indicates that Beth-eden was a seat of power or authority. The scepter is a symbol of kingship and rule, so the phrase implies that Beth-eden was a place from which the kings of Aram exercised their dominion. ¶Amos's prophecy against Aram was delivered during a time when the Arameans were a significant threat to Israel and Judah. The prophecy foretells the destruction of Damascus and the downfall of the Aramean rulers, including those associated with Beth-eden. ¶</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-eked was a place where Jehu killed the forty-two brothers of Ahaziah, king of Judah. (2 Kings 10:12, 14)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-eked, meaning &quot;house of binding&quot; or &quot;shearing house&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned in 2 Kings 10:12 and 14 in the context of Jehu's purge of the house of Ahab and the royal family of Judah. After Jehu had killed King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah, he set out to eliminate any potential rivals to his claim to the throne. ¶On his way to Samaria, Jehu came to Beth-eked, where he encountered forty-two brothers of Ahaziah. These men were likely coming to visit the royal family in Samaria, unaware of the recent coup. Jehu ordered his men to take the brothers alive and then slaughter them at the pit of Beth-eked. The text emphasizes that Jehu killed all forty-two men, leaving none of them alive. ¶The exact location of Beth-eked is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated between Jezreel and Samaria, possibly serving as a resting place for travelers or a center for sheep-shearing. The name &quot;Beth-eked&quot; suggests that it may have been a place where sheep were bound for shearing. ¶Jehu's actions at Beth-eked were part of his larger campaign to eliminate the house of Ahab and establish himself as the new king of Israel. His purge was seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Elijah against the house of Ahab (1 Kings 21:21-24). ¶</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bethel, also called Luz, was an important city in Israel, associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, later becoming a center of idolatry. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethel, meaning &quot;house of God&quot; in Hebrew, was an important city in ancient Israel, located about 10 miles north of Jerusalem. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob. ¶The city was originally called Luz (Genesis 28:19; 35:6; 48:3; Judges 1:23) and was renamed Bethel by Jacob after his vision of a ladder reaching to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). In this vision, God confirmed the covenant He had made with Abraham and promised to be with Jacob wherever he went. Jacob set up a stone pillar at the site, anointed it with oil, and made a vow to God. ¶Abraham had previously built an altar between Bethel and Ai (Genesis 12:8; 13:3), and Jacob later returned to Bethel, where he built an altar and received a renewed promise from God (Genesis 35:1-15). The place was also called El-bethel, meaning &quot;God of Bethel&quot; (Genesis 35:7). ¶During the period of the judges, Deborah held court under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel (Judges 4:5), and the Israelites went up to Bethel to seek guidance from God (Judges 20:18, 26; 21:2). The Ark of the Covenant was temporarily located at Bethel (Judges 20:27). ¶After the division of the kingdom, Jeroboam I set up a golden calf at Bethel to prevent the people from going to Jerusalem to worship (1 Kings 12:28-33). This act led to Bethel becoming a major center of idolatry, and the prophets Amos and Hosea condemned the worship there (Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5-6; 7:10, 13; Hosea 10:5, 8, 15). ¶The city was called Aven, meaning &quot;wickedness,&quot; by Hosea (Hosea 10:8) and Beth-aven, meaning &quot;house of wickedness,&quot; in other passages (Joshua 7:2; 18:12; 1 Samuel 13:5; 14:23), likely referring to its association with idolatry. ¶Bethel was destroyed by King Josiah during his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:4, 15-19) but was later resettled after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32; 11:31). ¶The city was also known as Bochim, meaning &quot;weepers,&quot; in Judges 2:1, 5, where an angel of the Lord rebuked the Israelites for their disobedience. ¶Bethel played a significant role in Israel's history, serving as a place of worship, a center of idolatry, and a symbol of God's presence and promises to His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-emek was a town in the territory of Asher, mentioned in the description of Asher's border. (Joshua 19:27)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-emek, meaning &quot;house of the valley&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 19:27, as part of the description of the border of the tribe of Asher. The town is listed along with other cities and landmarks, such as Cabul, Ebron, Rehob, and Hammon, which helped to delineate the extent of Asher's territory. ¶The exact location of Beth-emek is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the northwestern part of Canaan, within the allotted territory of Asher. The name &quot;Beth-emek&quot; suggests that the town was located in or near a valley. ¶Asher's territory was located along the Mediterranean coast, north of the tribe of Manasseh and south of the Phoenician city of Tyre. The region was known for its fertile land and abundant resources, as mentioned in the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33:24-25). ¶No other details about Beth-emek are provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its inclusion in the description of Asher's border serves primarily to help define the extent of the tribe's territory in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bether is a mountain or mountains mentioned in the Song of Solomon, possibly symbolizing separation between lovers. (Song of Solomon 2:17)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bether, or the &quot;mountains of Bether,&quot; is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the Song of Solomon 2:17. The verse reads, &quot;Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether.&quot; ¶The exact location of the mountains of Bether is unknown, and there is no other mention of this place in the Bible or other historical sources. Some scholars suggest that &quot;Bether&quot; may not refer to a specific geographical location but rather serve as a symbolic or poetic term. ¶The word &quot;Bether&quot; comes from a Hebrew root meaning &quot;to divide&quot; or &quot;to cut,&quot; which has led some interpreters to understand the phrase &quot;mountains of Bether&quot; as referring to &quot;mountains of separation&quot; or &quot;cleft mountains.&quot; This interpretation would fit the context of the Song of Solomon, which explores themes of love, longing, and separation between the lovers. ¶In this view, the mountains of Bether represent the obstacles or distances that separate the lovers, and the beloved is invited to come swiftly, like a gazelle or young stag, to overcome these barriers. The imagery of the gazelle and stag also suggests the agility, grace, and strength needed to traverse the rugged terrain of the mountains. ¶Other interpretations propose that the mountains of Bether may refer to a specific location, possibly in the region of Lebanon or Anti-Lebanon, known for its rugged terrain and natural beauty. However, without further biblical or historical evidence, the precise location remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bethesda (Bethzatha) was a pool in Jerusalem with five roofed colonnades, where Jesus healed a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. (John 5:2)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethesda, also known as Bethzatha, was a pool located in Jerusalem, mentioned in the Gospel of John. The name Bethesda is derived from the Hebrew term meaning &quot;house of mercy&quot; or &quot;house of grace,&quot; while Bethzatha comes from the Aramaic, meaning &quot;house of olives&quot; or &quot;house of the olive tree.&quot; ¶The pool is described as having five roofed colonnades or porticoes, suggesting a structure with covered walkways surrounding the pool. It was located near the Sheep Gate, which was likely a gate in the northern wall of the city, used for bringing sheep into Jerusalem for sacrificial purposes. ¶In John 5:1-15, Jesus visits the Pool of Bethesda and encounters a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. The man explains that he has been unable to enter the pool when the water is stirred up, as someone else always steps in before him. It was believed that an angel would periodically come down and stir up the water, and the first person to enter the pool after this would be healed of their infirmities. ¶Jesus, seeing the man and knowing his long-standing condition, asks him, &quot;Do you want to get well?&quot; The man responds by explaining his inability to enter the pool first. Jesus then commands him, &quot;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&quot; Instantly, the man is healed, takes up his mat, and starts walking. ¶This miracle leads to a controversy, as it occurred on the Sabbath, and the Jewish leaders considered carrying a mat on the Sabbath to be a violation of the law. Jesus later finds the man in the temple and advises him to stop sinning, lest something worse happens to him. ¶The Pool of Bethesda is an example of Jesus' power to heal and his authority over the Sabbath. It also highlights the contrast between the man's long-standing infirmity and the instantaneous nature of Jesus' healing. ¶Archaeologists have uncovered a site near the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem, which is believed to be the location of the Pool of Bethesda. The excavations revealed a pool with multiple porticoes, consistent with the biblical description.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-ezel was a town mentioned in Micah's prophecy, where the inhabitants could not offer support or refuge during a time of judgment. (Micah 1:11)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-ezel is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Micah, as part of a series of prophetic oracles against the towns and cities of Judah. The name Beth-ezel means &quot;house of rootedness&quot; or &quot;house of proximity&quot; in Hebrew, possibly indicating its close proximity to another significant location. ¶In Micah 1:11, the prophet declares, &quot;Pass on your way, inhabitants of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame; the inhabitants of Zaanan do not come out; the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place.&quot; This verse is part of a passage that describes the judgment coming upon various cities in Judah, using wordplay and poetic imagery to convey the message. ¶The exact location of Beth-ezel is unknown, but based on the context of Micah's prophecy, it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah, near the Philistine border. The towns mentioned in the surrounding verses, such as Shaphir, Zaanan, and Maroth, are also believed to be in this general area. ¶Micah's prophecy suggests that Beth-ezel would be unable to provide support or refuge to the inhabitants of the nearby town of Zaanan during the coming judgment. The phrase &quot;the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place&quot; indicates that Beth-ezel itself would be affected by the calamity and unable to offer assistance. ¶The prophecy against Beth-ezel and the other towns in Judah serves as a warning of the impending judgment due to the people's sins and a call to repentance and humility before God. The fate of Beth-ezel is tied to the larger narrative of God's judgment against Judah and the surrounding nations.</ext_description>

The exact location of Beth-gamul is unknown, but it was likely situated within the territory of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. ¶In the context of Jeremiah's prophecy, Beth-gamul is listed among other Moabite cities, such as Kiriathaim, Beth-meon, and Kerioth, which were to face destruction or capture by the Babylonians as a consequence of Moab's pride and idolatry. The prophecy declares that Moab will be destroyed and its cities will be laid waste, with no one to rebuild them. ¶The mention of Beth-gamul serves to emphasize the extent of the judgment against Moab, as even this relatively obscure town would not be spared from the coming destruction. The prophecy against Moab is part of a larger series of oracles against the nations surrounding Israel and Judah, demonstrating God's sovereignty and judgment over all nations. ¶</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-haccherem was a town in Judah, possibly fortified, mentioned by Jeremiah as a place to raise a signal fire. (Nehemiah 3:14; Jeremiah 6:1)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-haccherem, meaning &quot;house of the vineyard&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned twice in the Bible. In Nehemiah 3:14, it is listed as one of the sections of Jerusalem's wall that was repaired by Malchijah, the son of Rechab, who was the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem. This suggests that Beth-haccherem was a town or region near Jerusalem, possibly located in the hill country of Judah. ¶In Jeremiah 6:1, the prophet warns the people of Benjamin to flee from Jerusalem and to raise a signal fire in Beth-haccherem, as disaster and great destruction were coming from the north. This warning comes in the context of the impending Babylonian invasion and the judgment that would befall Jerusalem and Judah. ¶The mention of raising a signal fire in Beth-haccherem suggests that the town may have been situated on a high point or had a watchtower that could be used to send signals to the surrounding areas. Signal fires were used in ancient times to warn of approaching danger or to communicate important messages quickly over long distances. ¶The reference in Nehemiah indicates that Beth-haccherem had a ruler or administrator, implying that it was a town of some significance. Its proximity to Jerusalem and its role in the defense system of the city further underscore its importance. ¶The location of the town remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-haggan was a place near Jezreel where Ahaziah, king of Judah, fled from Jehu before being killed. (2 Kings 9:27)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-haggan, meaning &quot;house of the garden&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned only once in the Bible, in 2 Kings 9:27. The passage describes the events surrounding Jehu's coup against the house of Ahab and his pursuit of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, who was an ally of the Omride dynasty. ¶After Jehu had killed Joram, the king of Israel, he turned his attention to Ahaziah. When Ahaziah saw what had happened, he fled by the way of the garden house (Beth-haggan). Jehu pursued him and ordered his men to shoot Ahaziah in his chariot. Ahaziah was wounded and managed to escape to Megiddo, where he died. ¶The exact location of Beth-haggan is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated near Jezreel, the site of Joram's death. Jezreel was a significant city in the northern kingdom of Israel, serving as a royal residence for the Omride dynasty. ¶The mention of Beth-haggan as the place where Ahaziah fled suggests that it may have been a fortified location or a place of refuge. The name &quot;house of the garden&quot; may indicate the presence of a royal garden or a lush, well-watered area near Jezreel. ¶The death of Ahaziah at Megiddo, after fleeing from Beth-haggan, marked the end of his brief reign as king of Judah and solidified Jehu's position as the new ruler of Israel. This event also had significant implications for the relationship between the northern and southern kingdoms.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-haram (Beth-haran) was a town allotted to the tribe of Gad, east of the Jordan River, which they fortified. (Joshua 13:27; Numbers 32:36)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-haram, also known as Beth-haran, was a town located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Gad, east of the Jordan River. The name Beth-haram means &quot;house of the high place&quot; or &quot;house of the mountain&quot; in Hebrew, possibly referring to its location on a hill or elevated area. ¶In Numbers 32:36, Beth-haran is mentioned as one of the towns that the Gadites built or fortified, along with Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, and other cities. This occurred after the Israelites had conquered the territories east of the Jordan and before they crossed the river to enter the Promised Land. ¶In Joshua 13:27, Beth-haram is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Gad in the Jordan Valley, along with Beth-nimrah and Succoth. This passage describes the extent of Gad's territory, which stretched from the Jabbok River in the south to the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) in the north. ¶The fortification of Beth-haram by the Gadites suggests that it was a strategically important town, possibly guarding a trade route or serving as a defensive outpost. Its location in the Jordan Valley would have made it a valuable agricultural area, benefiting from the fertile soil and the proximity to water sources. ¶No other details about Beth-haram are provided in the Bible, and the exact location of the town remains uncertain. Some scholars propose that it may be identified with Tell Iktanu, an archaeological site in the Jordan Valley, but this identification is not conclusive.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-hoglah, meaning &quot;house of the partridge&quot; in Hebrew, was a town located on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is mentioned three times in the book of Joshua, always in the context of defining the boundaries of these two tribes. ¶In Joshua 15:6, Beth-hoglah is described as being part of the northern border of Judah, near the end of the Salt Sea (Dead Sea). The border went up to Beth-hoglah and passed north of it, indicating that the town itself was within Judah's territory. ¶In Joshua 18:19 and 21, Beth-hoglah is listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Benjamin. The border of Benjamin is described as passing south of Beth-hoglah, confirming its location on the boundary between the two tribes. ¶The exact location of Beth-hoglah is not specified in the Bible, but based on the descriptions in Joshua, it was likely situated in the Jordan Valley, near the northern end of the Dead Sea. Its proximity to the Dead Sea and its location on the border between Judah and Benjamin suggest that it may have been an important town for trade, agriculture, or defense. ¶The name &quot;house of the partridge&quot; may refer to the presence of these birds in the area or to a local feature that resembled a partridge.

		<short_description>Lower Beth-horon was a town allotted to Ephraim and Dan, known for a battle where the sun stood still. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Lower Beth-horon was a town located in the border region between the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin, in the central hill country of Israel. It is mentioned multiple times in the Bible, often in connection with its sister city, Upper Beth-horon. ¶The name Beth-horon means &quot;house of caves&quot; or &quot;house of hollows&quot; in Hebrew, possibly referring to the topography of the area. Lower Beth-horon was situated in a strategic location along the main road connecting the coastal plain with Jerusalem and the interior of the country. ¶In the book of Joshua, Lower Beth-horon is described as part of the border between Ephraim and Benjamin (Joshua 16:3; 18:13). It was allotted to the Kohathite clan of the Levites (Joshua 21:22; 1 Chronicles 6:68). ¶The most famous biblical event associated with Lower Beth-horon is the battle between the Israelites and the Amorite kings, described in Joshua 10. As the Amorites fled before Israel, God cast down large hailstones on them, and Joshua prayed for the sun to stand still, allowing the Israelites to complete their victory (Joshua 10:10-11). ¶In later history, Lower Beth-horon was fortified by King Solomon (1 Kings 9:17; 2 Chronicles 8:5) and was the site of a battle between Judah and Israel during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah (2 Chronicles 25:13). ¶The Philistines also used the Beth-horon road as one of their main routes for invading Israelite territory (1 Samuel 13:18). ¶Both Lower and Upper Beth-horon were rebuilt by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:24). ¶Today, the ancient site of Lower Beth-horon is identified with the modern Palestinian village of Beit Ur al-Tahta.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Upper Beth-horon was a town located in the territory of Ephraim, near its border with Benjamin. It was situated in the central hill country of Israel, not far from its sister city, Lower Beth-horon. ¶The name Beth-horon means &quot;house of caves&quot; or &quot;house of hollows&quot; in Hebrew, possibly referring to the topography of the area. Upper Beth-horon was located at a higher elevation than Lower Beth-horon and was connected to it by a road known as the Ascent of Beth-horon. ¶In Joshua 16:5, Upper Beth-horon is mentioned as part of the description of Ephraim's border. The town was rebuilt by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim, along with Lower Beth-horon (1 Chronicles 7:24). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Upper Beth-horon was one of the cities he fortified as part of his building projects (2 Chronicles 8:5). This fortification was likely due to the town's strategic location along the road connecting the coastal plain with the interior of the country. ¶Although Upper Beth-horon is mentioned less frequently in the Bible than Lower Beth-horon, its proximity to the latter and its inclusion in the list of fortified cities suggest that it played a significant role in the defense and administration of the region. ¶Today, the ancient site of Upper Beth-horon is identified with the modern Palestinian village of Beit Ur al-Foqa.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-jeshimoth was a town located in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River and near the Dead Sea. The name Beth-jeshimoth means &quot;house of desolations&quot; or &quot;house of the desert&quot; in Hebrew. ¶In Numbers 33:49, Beth-jeshimoth is mentioned as one of the places where the Israelites camped during their journey through the wilderness, shortly before crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land. The camp extended from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. ¶After the conquest of Canaan, Beth-jeshimoth was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Joshua 13:20). It was situated in the Arabah, the Jordan Valley, south of the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee). ¶In Joshua 12:3, Beth-jeshimoth is listed among the cities and territories conquered by the Israelites under Moses' leadership, along with the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites. ¶The prophet Ezekiel, in a prophecy against Moab, mentions Beth-jeshimoth as one of the cities that would be given to the people of the East as a possession, along with Baal-meon and Kiriathaim (Ezekiel 25:9). This prophecy indicates that Beth-jeshimoth was a significant Moabite town and that it would share the fate of other cities in the region due to Moab's pride and hostility towards Israel. ¶The exact location of Beth-jeshimoth is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea, possibly at the site known as Khirbet es-Suweimeh.</ext_description>

This suggests that the two names refer to the same place, with Beth-lebaoth being a more descriptive or formal name. ¶The exact location of Beth-lebaoth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, the southern part of Judah's territory. The towns allotted to Simeon were generally in the southern and western parts of Judah, as the tribe's inheritance was within the larger territory of Judah (Joshua 19:1, 9). ¶No other details about Beth-lebaoth are provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context.

		<ext_description>Bethlehem, mentioned in Joshua 19:15, is a town distinct from the more famous Bethlehem in Judah. This Bethlehem was located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Zebulun during the division of the Promised Land. ¶The name Bethlehem means &quot;house of bread&quot; in Hebrew, suggesting that the area was known for its fertility or grain production. The town is listed among other cities in Zebulun's inheritance, such as Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem, indicating its geographical proximity to these places. ¶Zebulun's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, in the region of Galilee. The exact location of this Bethlehem is uncertain, but it was likely situated within the boundaries of Zebulun, which stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. ¶No other information about this Bethlehem is provided in the Bible, and it is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context.

		<short_description>Bethlehem, also called Ephrath or Ephrathah, was the city where David and Jesus were born, located in Judah. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethlehem, also known as Ephrath or Ephrathah, is a city located in the hill country of Judah, approximately 5 miles south of Jerusalem. The name Bethlehem means &quot;house of bread,&quot; while Ephrath or Ephrathah means &quot;fruitful.&quot; ¶Bethlehem is first mentioned in the Bible as the burial place of Rachel, Jacob's wife (Genesis 35:19; 48:7). It was also the hometown of Ibzan, one of the judges of Israel (Judges 12:8, 10). ¶During the period of the judges, a Levite from Bethlehem became a priest for Micah's idolatrous shrine (Judges 17:7-9). Later, a Levite from Bethlehem traveled to Gibeah, where his concubine was mistreated, leading to a war between the Israelites and the Benjamites (Judges 19:1-2, 18). ¶The book of Ruth is set primarily in Bethlehem, where Naomi and her family were from (Ruth 1:1-2, 19, 22). Boaz, who married Ruth, was also from Bethlehem (Ruth 2:4; 4:11). ¶Bethlehem is most famously known as the hometown of King David (1 Samuel 16:1, 18; 17:12, 15; 20:6, 28). It was in Bethlehem that Samuel anointed David as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16:4). During David's reign, the city was referred to as the &quot;city of David&quot; (Luke 2:4, 11). ¶Several of David's mighty men, including Abishai and Elhanan, were from Bethlehem (2 Samuel 23:24; 1 Chronicles 11:26; 2 Samuel 21:19). ¶In the New Testament, Bethlehem is celebrated as the birthplace of Jesus Christ (Matthew 2:1, 5-6, 8, 16; Luke 2:4, 15; John 7:42). The Magi visited Jesus in Bethlehem, and King Herod ordered the massacre of the innocents there in an attempt to kill the newborn king (Matthew 2:16). ¶The prophet Micah foretold that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and this prophecy is cited in Matthew 2:5-6.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-merchak is mentioned only once in the Bible, in 2 Samuel 15:17, during the account of Absalom's revolt against his father, King David. The name Beth-merchak means &quot;house of distance&quot; or &quot;house of the far place&quot; in Hebrew. ¶As Absalom's conspiracy gained strength, David decided to flee from Jerusalem to escape the impending danger. The king left the city with his entire household, except for ten concubines who were left to take care of the palace. ¶David and his followers stopped at a place some distance from the city, which is referred to as Beth-merchak. The text does not provide the exact location of this place, but it was likely a short distance from Jerusalem, possibly a suburb or a neighboring village. ¶At Beth-merchak, David reviewed the people who were with him, including his servants and loyal followers. It was here that he encountered Ittai the Gittite, who pledged his loyalty to David despite being a foreigner</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-millo was a fortified place in Shechem where the men of the city made Abimelech king, later becoming his enemies. (Judges 9:6, 20)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-millo, meaning &quot;house of the filling&quot; or &quot;house of the rampart&quot; in Hebrew, was a fortified place or citadel within the city of Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim. It is mentioned in the context of Abimelech's rise to power and his subsequent conflict with the people of Shechem. ¶In Judges 9:6, the men of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered together to make Abimelech, the son of Gideon (Jerubbaal), king over them. This event took place by the terebinth tree at the pillar in Shechem, suggesting that Beth-millo was a significant part of the city and that its inhabitants had a say in the selection of their ruler. ¶However, the relationship between Abimelech and the people of Shechem and Beth-millo deteriorated over time. In Judges 9:20, Jotham, Abimelech's half-brother, prophesied that fire would come from Abimelech to devour the men of Shechem and Beth-millo and that fire would come from them to devour Abimelech. This prophecy came true when the men of Shechem turned against Abimelech and he, in turn, destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants (Judges 9:23-49). ¶The exact nature and location of Beth-millo within Shechem are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it may have been a fortified citadel or a residential area for the city's upper class. Others propose that it could have been a part of the city's defensive structures, such as a filled-in rampart or a tower. ¶The story of Abimelech and Beth-millo highlights the political instability and power struggles that characterized the period of the judges in Israel's history. It also demonstrates the consequences of making alliances with those who do not follow God's ways.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-nimrah, also known as Nimrah, was a town located east of the Jordan River, in the territory allotted to the tribe of Gad.

Moses granted their request on the condition that they would help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan (Numbers 32:20-22). ¶Later, in Numbers 32:36, Beth-nimrah is mentioned as one of the cities that the Gadites built or fortified, along with Aroer, Atroth, Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-pelet was a town in southern Judah, allotted to Judah and later resettled by the people of Judah after the Babylonian exile. (Joshua 15:27; Nehemiah 11:26)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-pelet, meaning &quot;house of escape&quot; or &quot;house of flight&quot; in Hebrew, was a town located in the southern part of Judah's territory, in the Negev region. It is mentioned twice in the Bible, first in Joshua 15:27 as part of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. ¶The second mention of Beth-pelet is in Nehemiah 11:26, where it is listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after their return from the Babylonian exile. This suggests that Beth-pelet was one of the towns that had been inhabited by the Judahites before the exile and was later reoccupied when they returned to their homeland. ¶The exact location of Beth-pelet is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the arid region south of Hebron, along with other towns mentioned in the same context, such as Moladah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. ¶No other information about Beth-pelet is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its name, &quot;house of escape&quot; or &quot;house of flight,&quot; may refer to its function as a place of refuge or to a local event or feature associated with escape or flight.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-peor was a place east of the Jordan River, where the Israelites camped and Moses was buried in an unknown valley. (Deuteronomy 3:29; 4:46; 34:6; Joshua 13:20)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-peor, meaning &quot;house of Peor&quot; or &quot;temple of Peor&quot; in Hebrew, was a place located east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab. It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and the events leading up to their entry into the Promised Land. ¶In Deuteronomy 3:29, Beth-peor is mentioned as the place where the Israelites camped before Moses delivered his final discourses to the people. The text specifies that they stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor. ¶Deuteronomy 4:46 again refers to Beth-peor as the location where Moses spoke to the Israelites, giving them the statutes and judgments that they were to observe in the land they were about to enter. ¶The most significant event associated with Beth-peor is the death and burial of Moses. In Deuteronomy 34:6, it is recorded that Moses died in the land of Moab and was buried in a valley opposite Beth-peor. However, the exact location of his grave remains unknown, as the text states that &quot;no one knows his grave to this day.&quot; ¶In Joshua 13:20, Beth-peor is mentioned as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben, along with other cities in the plains of Moab. ¶The name Beth-peor suggests that the place was associated with the worship of the Moabite god Peor. This connection is further supported by the events recorded in Numbers 25, where the Israelites engaged in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites, worshipping Baal of Peor. As a result, a plague struck the Israelites, and Moses was commanded to execute the leaders of the people. ¶The location of Beth-peor is not precisely known, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Mount Nebo, from where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death (Deuteronomy 34:1-4).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bethphage was a village near Bethany, where Jesus sent His disciples to find a donkey and a colt for His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. (Matthew 21:1; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:29)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethphage, meaning &quot;house of unripe figs&quot; in Hebrew, was a village located on the Mount of Olives, near Bethany, just east of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. ¶In Matthew 21:1, Mark 11:1, and Luke 19:29, Jesus and His disciples approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. It was from Bethphage that Jesus sent two of His disciples to retrieve a donkey and a colt, on which He would ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶The fact that Bethphage is mentioned alongside Bethany suggests that the two villages were in close proximity to each other. Bethany is known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11:1, 38-44). ¶The exact location of Bethphage is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, near the road leading from Jericho to Jerusalem. Its name, &quot;house of unripe figs,&quot; may refer to the presence of fig trees in the area or to a local feature associated with the cultivation or processing of figs. ¶Bethphage's significance in the Gospels lies in its role as the starting point for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which marked the beginning of the events leading up to His crucifixion and resurrection. The village's proximity to Jerusalem and its location on the Mount of Olives, a site of great prophetic and eschatological importance, further underscores its significance in the Gospel narrative.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-rehob (Rehob) was an Aramean city and region, allied with the Ammonites against David, located near the northern border of Israel. (Judges 18:28; 2 Samuel 10:6, 8; Numbers 13:21)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-rehob, also known as Rehob, was an Aramean city and region located in the north of Israel, near the border with Aram (Syria). It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan and later during the reign of King David. ¶In Numbers 13:21, the spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan are said to have gone as far north as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. This suggests that Rehob was located in the northernmost part of the Promised Land, close to the entrance of Hamath, a major city in Syria. ¶In Judges 18:28, Rehob is mentioned as a reference point to describe the location of Laish, a city that the Danites conquered and renamed Dan. The text states that Laish was situated near Beth-rehob, indicating the proximity of the two places. ¶During the reign of King David, Beth-rehob played a role in the conflict between Israel and the Ammonites. In 2 Samuel 10:6, the Ammonites, facing an impending attack from David's army, hired Aramean mercenaries from various regions, including Beth-rehob, to help them in battle. The Arameans of Beth-rehob, along with those from Zobah, provided 20,000 foot soldiers to support the Ammonites. ¶In the subsequent battle at Helam (2 Samuel 10:8), the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, together with the Ammonites, faced David's army, led by Joab and Abishai. The Israelites defeated the Arameans and Ammonites, and the Arameans made peace with Israel, fearing to help the Ammonites any further. ¶The exact location of Beth-rehob is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Aram, north of Israel, possibly in the area known as the Beqaa Valley in modern-day Lebanon. Its association with the Arameans and its proximity to Hamath suggest that it was an important city or region in the Aramean kingdom.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bethsaida was a fishing village on the Sea of Galilee, notable as the hometown of several of Jesus' disciples and a place where He performed miracles.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bethsaida was a fishing town located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was the hometown of the disciples Philip, Andrew, and Peter (John 1:44, 12:21). Jesus visited Bethsaida during His ministry and performed several miracles there, including healing a blind man (Mark 8:22-26). Bethsaida was one of the cities, along with Chorazin and Capernaum, that Jesus rebuked for their unbelief despite the mighty works He had done in their midst (Matthew 11:21, Luke 10:13). After the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus instructed His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida while He dismissed the crowd (Mark 6:45). The exact location of Bethsaida is debated, but it was likely situated near where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida's name derives from the Hebrew for &quot;house of fishing&quot; or &quot;house of hunting,&quot; reflecting its primary industry. The Bible portrays Bethsaida as a place of great spiritual opportunity that largely failed to respond to Jesus' message and miracles.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Beth-shean (Beth-shan) was a city allotted to Manasseh, where the Philistines fastened Saul's body to the wall after his death. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-shean, also known as Beth-shan, was a city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, although it was situated within the borders of Issachar. The city was strategically positioned at the junction of the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys, controlling access to the Jezreel Valley from the east. ¶In Joshua 17:11 and 16, Beth-shean is listed among the cities and towns within Manasseh's inheritance that were not fully conquered by the Israelites. The Manassites were unable to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. ¶Judges 1:27 reiterates that Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites continued to live there. ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shean was included in the fifth administrative district overseen by Baana, son of Ahilud (1 Kings 4:12). The city's inclusion in this list suggests its ongoing importance and the presence of a significant Israelite population. ¶The most notable event associated with Beth-shean in the Bible is the aftermath of the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. In 1 Samuel 31:10-12, after Saul and his sons were killed in battle, the Philistines fastened their bodies to the wall of Beth-shean. When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard about this, they travelled through the night, took down the bodies, and buried them in Jabesh. ¶Later, during David's reign, the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan were retrieved from Jabesh-gilead and buried in the tomb of Saul's father, Kish, in Benjamin (2 Samuel 21:12-14). ¶Beth-shean's strategic location made it a target for conquest throughout history. The city was eventually captured by the Egyptians and later by the Assyrians. It was known as Scythopolis during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, serving as the leading city of the Decapolis, a group of ten Hellenistic cities in the region.</ext_description>

This Beth-shemesh is distinct from the cities of the same name in Judah and Issachar. ¶In Joshua 19:38, Beth-shemesh is listed among the fortified cities in Naphtali's inheritance, along with other cities such as Ziddim, Zer, and Hazor. The inclusion of Beth-shemesh in this list suggests that it was a significant city with defensive structures and walls. ¶Judges 1:33 reveals that the tribe of Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath, and the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. However, when Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely. ¶The exact location of Beth-shemesh in Naphtali is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, in the region known as the Galilee.

		<short_description>Beth-shemesh was a city allotted to Judah and the Levites, associated with the return of the Ark of the Covenant from the Philistines. (Multiple references, see article for details)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-shemesh, meaning &quot;house of the sun&quot; in Hebrew, was a city located in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah. It was allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:10) and later given to the Levites of the family of Aaron (Joshua 21:16; 1 Chronicles 6:59). ¶Beth-shemesh is primarily known for its association with the return of the Ark of the Covenant from the Philistines (1 Samuel 6). After the Ark had been captured by the Philistines, they sent it back on a cart, guided by two milk cows. The cows miraculously went straight to Beth-shemesh, where the people were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley (1 Samuel 6:9, 12-13). ¶The men of Beth-shemesh rejoiced when they saw the Ark, offering the cows as a burnt offering and sacrificing to the Lord (1 Samuel 6:14-15). However, some of the men looked inside the Ark, and as a result, God struck down 70 men (some manuscripts say 50,070) for their irreverence (1 Samuel 6:19-20). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shemesh was included in the second administrative district overseen by Ben-Deker (1 Kings 4:9). ¶Later, during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah, a battle took place between Amaziah and King Jehoash of Israel at Beth-shemesh. Amaziah was defeated and captured by Jehoash, who then proceeded to break down a section of the wall of Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:11-13; 2 Chronicles 25:21-23). ¶In the time of King Ahaz of Judah, the Philistines invaded the cities of the Shephelah, including Beth-shemesh, capturing and occupying them (2 Chronicles 28:18). ¶The city of Beth-shemesh is also mentioned in Judges 1:35, where it is stated that the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. Mount Heres, meaning &quot;mount of the sun,&quot; is likely another name for Beth-shemesh or the hill on which it was located.</ext_description>

The hill country of Judah was known for its rugged terrain, with steep hills and narrow valleys, making it a natural defensive region. ¶The name &quot;Beth-tappuah&quot; suggests that the area was known for its apple orchards or that apples were an important product of the town. In ancient times, the term &quot;apple&quot; could have referred to various fruits, such as apricots, quinces, or even citrons. ¶No other information about Beth-tappuah is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context.

		<short_description>Beth-togarmah was a region or people group that traded horses and mules with Tyre and was allied with Gog, a future enemy of Israel. (Ezekiel 27:14; 38:6)</short_description>
		<ext_description>Beth-togarmah is mentioned twice in the Book of Ezekiel, both times in the context of prophetic visions concerning the future of Israel and the nations surrounding it. ¶In Ezekiel 27:14, Beth-togarmah is listed among the trading partners of the city of Tyre, a major commercial center on the Mediterranean coast. The people of Beth-togarmah are described as supplying horses, war horses, and mules to the markets of Tyre. This suggests that Beth-togarmah was known for its livestock, particularly horses, and that it had a significant role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network. ¶The exact location of Beth-togarmah is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Armenia or Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Some scholars propose that the name &quot;Beth-togarmah&quot; may be related to the Anatolian city of Tegarama, known from Hittite texts, or to the Armenian city of Tilgarimmu, mentioned in Assyrian records. ¶In Ezekiel 38:6, Beth-togarmah is mentioned again, this time in the context of a prophetic vision about a future invasion of Israel by a coalition of nations led by Gog, from the land of Magog. Beth-togarmah is described as being &quot;from the far north,&quot; along with Gomer and its troops, suggesting a geographical location north of Israel. This prophecy portrays Beth-togarmah as one of the allies of Gog in the latter days, participating in the attack on Israel. ¶The prophecy in Ezekiel 38-39 is often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, with Gog and its allies representing the nations that oppose God and His people. The ultimate defeat of Gog and its allies, including Beth-togarmah, emphasizes God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph of His kingdom.</ext_description>

The name Bethuel means &quot;destroyed of God&quot; or &quot;man of God&quot; in Hebrew. ¶Simeon's territory was located within the larger area allotted to Judah, in the southern part of Canaan (Joshua 19:1, 9). The towns listed in 1 Chronicles 4:28-33 represent the settlements inhabited by the Simeonites during the reign of King David. ¶In the parallel list of Simeon's towns in Joshua 19:4, the name Bethul appears instead of Bethuel. This suggests that the two names refer to the same place, with Bethul being a variant spelling or a scribal error. ¶The exact location of Bethuel is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Judah. The Negev was known for its arid climate and sparse vegetation, making it suitable for pasturing flocks and herds. ¶No other information about Bethuel is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its inclusion in the list of Simeon's towns highlights the extent of the tribe's territory and the variety of settlements within it.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Beth-zur, meaning &quot;house of rock&quot; or &quot;house of the wall&quot; in Hebrew, was a town located in the hill country of Judah, mentioned several times in the Old Testament. It was one of the towns allotted to Judah during the division of the Promised Land (Joshua 15:58). ¶Beth-zur was associated with Maon, as Maon was the father of Beth-zur (1 Chronicles 2:45). This may suggest that Beth-zur was founded by the descendants of Maon or that it was a satellite settlement of Maon. ¶During the reign of King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Beth-zur was one of the cities fortified for the defense of Judah (2 Chronicles 11:7). This fortification was part of Rehoboam's strategy to strengthen his kingdom against potential threats from the northern tribes of Israel and neighboring nations. ¶Later, in the time of Nehemiah, after the return from the Babylonian exile, Beth-zur was one of the towns whose walls were repaired (Nehemiah 3:16). The mention of Beth-zur in this context suggests that it had been inhabited before the exile and was being restored as part of the rebuilding of Judah. ¶The exact location of Beth-zur is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the ancient city of Hebron. Its location in the hill country would have made it a strategic point for defense and control of the surrounding area. ¶No other significant events or people are directly associated with Beth-zur in the Bible.

		<ext_description>Bezek is mentioned in the Bible as the place where King Saul gathered the Israelite army before fighting against the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11:8). The Ammonites, led by King Nahash, had besieged the city of Jabesh-gilead and threatened to gouge out the right eye of all its inhabitants. Saul, recently anointed as king, summoned the Israelites to assemble at Bezek. He mustered an army of three hundred thousand men from Israel and thirty thousand from Judah. From Bezek, Saul led the army to Jabesh-gilead and defeated the Ammonites, saving the city and its people. The location of this Bezek is uncertain, but it may have been situated in the territory of Manasseh, west of the Jordan River. It is likely a different place from the Bezek mentioned in Judges 1:4-5.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Bezer, also called Bozrah, was a Levitical city of refuge in the territory of Reuben.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Bezer, also known as Bozrah, was a city located in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It was allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of their inheritance in the Transjordan (Joshua 20:8, 21:36; 1 Chronicles 6:78). Moses designated Bezer as one of the six cities of refuge, where a person who accidentally killed someone could flee for protection from avengers (Deuteronomy 4:43). The city was also given to the Levites of the clan of Merari (Joshua 21:36, 1 Chronicles 6:78). ¶The prophet Jeremiah mentioned Bozrah in his oracle against Moab, indicating that it was an important city in the region (Jeremiah 48:24). The name Bozrah means &quot;sheepfold&quot; or &quot;fortress,&quot; suggesting that it may have been a fortified city or a center for sheep herding. ¶The exact location of Bezer is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, within the territory of Reuben. It should not be confused with the Edomite city of Bozrah mentioned in other biblical passages (Genesis 36:33, Isaiah 34:6, 63:1, Amos 1:12).</ext_description>

It served as the capital of Edom during the reign of King Jobab, son of Zerah (Genesis 36:33, 1 Chronicles 1:44). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos mention Bozrah in their oracles of judgment against Edom (Isaiah 34:6, 63:1; Jeremiah 49:13, 22; Amos 1:12). These prophecies depict Bozrah as a symbol of Edom's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment. ¶Isaiah's prophecy portrays God as a warrior coming from Bozrah with blood-stained garments, symbolizing His vengeance against Edom (Isaiah 63:1-6). Jeremiah foretells that Bozrah would become a desolation and a curse, with its inhabitants fleeing in terror (Jeremiah 49:13, 22). Amos declares that God would send fire upon Bozrah, consuming its palaces (Amos 1:12). ¶The exact location of Bozrah is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern town of Busaira in southern Jordan. It should not be confused with the Levitical city of Bezer, also called Bozrah, in the territory of Reuben (Deuteronomy 4:43, Joshua 20:8).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Broad Wall was a section of Jerusalem's wall rebuilt during Nehemiah's time.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Broad Wall was a section of Jerusalem's city wall mentioned in the book of Nehemiah. During Nehemiah's rebuilding of the city walls, repairs were made to the Broad Wall by Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph (Nehemiah 3:8). The wall's exact location is not specified, but it was likely a significant defensive structure, possibly wider or more substantial than other parts of the wall. ¶Later, during the dedication of the completed wall, two choirs proceeded in opposite directions along the top of the wall. One choir went past the Broad Wall to the Ephraim Gate (Nehemiah 12:38), indicating that the Broad Wall was located in the northern part of the city, possibly near the Temple area. ¶The Broad Wall's construction and repair were part of Nehemiah's efforts to restore Jerusalem's defenses and rebuild the city after the Babylonian exile. Its mention in the Bible highlights the importance of fortifications in ancient cities and the significance of Nehemiah's work in revitalizing Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Brook of Egypt (Shihor) marked the southwestern boundary of the Promised Land.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Brook of Egypt, also known as Shihor, was a waterway that marked the southwestern boundary of the Promised Land. It is mentioned in several passages describing the extent of the Israelite territory (Numbers 34:5; Joshua 15:4, 47; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Chronicles 7:8; Ezekiel 47:19; 48:28). The Brook of Egypt is generally identified with the Wadi el-Arish, a seasonal stream that flows into the Mediterranean Sea near the modern border between Israel and Egypt. ¶In Joshua 13:3, Shihor is described as being &quot;east of Egypt,&quot; suggesting that it was a separate body of water from the Nile River. However, in Isaiah 23:3, Shihor seems to be associated with the Nile, possibly referring to one of its eastern branches. The Brook of Egypt served not only as a geographical boundary but also as a symbol of the extent of God's promise to Israel and the limit of their conquest. During the reign of King Josiah, the Brook of Egypt was mentioned as the southern limit of Judah's territory (2 Kings 24:7).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Brook of the Arabah is mentioned in the Bible as the eastern boundary of the kingdom of Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II (Amos 6:14). Jeroboam II was a powerful king who expanded Israel's territory and restored its borders to their former extent. The Brook of the Arabah likely refers to the Wadi Zered, a seasonal stream that flows into the Dead Sea from the east, marking the boundary between Moab and Edom. ¶Amos's prophecy indicates that God would judge Israel for their sins, and their territory would be invaded from the Brook of the Arabah to the entrance of Hamath in the north. This prophecy highlights the extent of Israel's kingdom under Jeroboam II and the impending judgment that would befall them. The Brook of the Arabah serves as a geographical marker, emphasizing the scope of both Israel's power and their coming downfall.</ext_description>

The exact location of the Brook of the Willows is uncertain, but some scholars identify it with the Wadi Zered, a seasonal stream that flows into the Dead Sea from the east. ¶Isaiah's prophecy describes the devastation that would come upon Moab, causing its people to flee and carry their possessions to the Brook of the Willows. The mention of this brook highlights the extent of Moab's territory and the severity of the judgment that would force them to flee to their borders. The name &quot;Brook of the Willows&quot; may indicate the presence of willow trees along its banks, which could have provided shelter for the fleeing Moabites.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Buz is mentioned in Jeremiah's prophecy as one of the Arabian tribes that would face God's judgment (Jeremiah 25:23). The tribe of Buz is listed alongside Dedan, Tema, and the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert. This suggests that Buz was a nomadic or semi-nomadic tribe inhabiting the Arabian desert, possibly in the region east of the Jordan River. ¶The name Buz may be derived from Buz, the son of Nahor and nephew of Abraham (Genesis 22:21), indicating that the tribe descended from him. However, this connection is not explicitly stated in the Bible. Jeremiah's prophecy implies that the tribe of Buz, along with other Arabian tribes, would suffer the consequences of their sins and face God's judgment. The inclusion of Buz in this prophecy highlights the far-reaching scope of God's judgment and the accountability of all nations before Him.</ext_description>

Solomon had received gold, cedar, and cypress wood from Hiram for the construction of the Temple and his palace. In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. However, when Hiram visited the cities, he was displeased with them and called them &quot;Cabul,&quot; which means &quot;good for nothing&quot; or &quot;like nothing.&quot; ¶The exact location and identity of these cities are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that they may have been located in the northern part of Israel, near the border with Tyre. The story highlights the relationship between Solomon and Hiram, as well as the exchange of resources and territories between their kingdoms. It also shows that not all gifts or transactions were satisfactory to both parties involved.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Caesarea was a coastal city in Judea that served as a center of Roman administration.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Caesarea was a coastal city located in Judea, approximately 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Joppa. It was built by Herod the Great between 22 and 10 BC and named in honor of Augustus Caesar. Caesarea served as the capital of the Roman province of Judea and the official residence of the Roman governors. ¶In the New Testament, Caesarea is mentioned several times in the book of Acts. Philip the evangelist settled in Caesarea after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:40). The apostle Peter visited Caesarea and preached to the Gentile centurion Cornelius, leading to his conversion (Acts 10:1-48). Paul passed through Caesarea on his missionary journeys (Acts 9:30; 18:22) and was later imprisoned there for two years before being sent to Rome for trial (Acts 23:23-26:32). ¶Caesarea was known for its impressive harbor, which was constructed using advanced Roman engineering techniques. The city also featured a temple dedicated to Augustus, an amphitheater, a hippodrome, and a Roman aqueduct. As a center of Roman administration and a hub for trade, Caesarea played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity and the interaction between the Jewish and Gentile believers.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Caesarea Philippi was a city located in the northern part of Israel, near the base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in the New Testament as the place where Jesus asked his disciples, &quot;Who do people say the Son of Man is?&quot; (Matthew 16:13; Mark 8:27). In response, Simon Peter acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16). ¶The city was originally known as Paneas, named after the Greek god Pan. It was later rebuilt and renamed Caesarea Philippi by Philip the Tetrarch, son of Herod the Great, in honor of himself and the Roman emperor. The city was known for its temple dedicated to Pan and its proximity to a large spring that fed the Jordan River. ¶Jesus' conversation with his disciples at Caesarea Philippi marked a turning point in his ministry. It was here that he began to reveal more openly his identity as the Messiah and his impending death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31). The location, with its pagan associations and Gentile population, also symbolized the expanding mission of the gospel beyond the Jewish people.</ext_description>

It was located along the Tigris River, south of Nineveh, in what is now northern Iraq. Calah, together with Nineveh and Resen, formed a complex of major Assyrian cities known for their power and influence in the ancient Near East. ¶The city of Calah served as the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reigns of several powerful kings, including Ashurnasirpal II and Tiglath-pileser III. It was known for its impressive palaces, temples, and artistic achievements. Archaeological excavations at the site, known today as Nimrud, have uncovered significant remains of the ancient city, including royal inscriptions, reliefs, and statues. ¶In the Bible, Calah is mentioned only in the context of Nimrod's kingdom and the early development of Assyria. Its inclusion in the list of Nimrod's cities highlights the importance and antiquity of the Assyrian civilization, which would later play a significant role in the history of Israel and Judah.</ext_description>

The verse states that after Hezron's death in Caleb Ephrathah, his wife Abijah bore him a son named Ashhur, who became the father of Tekoa. ¶The exact location and significance of Caleb Ephrathah are unclear from this single reference. Some scholars suggest that it may refer to a region or a town associated with the descendants of Caleb, the faithful spy who was rewarded with a portion of the Promised Land (Numbers 14:24; Joshua 14:13-14). The name Ephrathah is also associated with Bethlehem, the birthplace of David (Ruth 4:11; Micah 5:2). ¶However, due to the limited information provided in the Bible, the precise nature and location of Caleb Ephrathah remain uncertain. Its mention in the genealogy of Judah serves to provide a detail about the death of Hezron and the birth of Ashhur, connecting the lineage of Judah to the inhabitants of Tekoa.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Calneh (Calno) was an ancient city in Mesopotamia, mentioned as one of Nimrod's cities and later as a trading partner of Tyre.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Calneh, also known as Calno, was an ancient city mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities founded by Nimrod in the land of Shinar (Genesis 10:10). It is also referred to in the prophetic books of Amos (6:2) and Isaiah (10:9) as a city of significance, and in Ezekiel (27:23) as a trading partner of Tyre. ¶The exact location of Calneh is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been situated in Mesopotamia, in the region of Babylonia or Assyria. Some scholars identify it with the ancient city of Kullania or Kullanhu, known from Assyrian inscriptions, which was located near the Tigris River. ¶In the Bible, Calneh is mentioned alongside other notable cities such as Babel, Erech, and Accad, suggesting its importance in the ancient Near Eastern world. The prophet Amos used Calneh as an example of a great city that had fallen, warning Israel of impending judgment (Amos 6:2). Similarly, Isaiah mentioned Calneh in the context of Assyria's conquests and its arrogance against God (Isaiah 10:9). ¶Ezekiel's reference to Calneh as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23) indicates that the city was involved in commercial activities and had established economic ties with other major centers in the region. ¶Although the biblical references to Calneh are brief, they suggest that it was a city of considerable significance in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its political, economic, and cultural importance. Its association with Nimrod and its mention alongside other prominent cities underscore its place in the early history of human civilization.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Canaan was the ancient region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, named after Noah's grandson and later promised to Abraham's descendants.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Canaan refers to both a region and a people group in the Bible. As a region, Canaan was the ancient name for the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, roughly corresponding to modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Syria and Jordan. It was the land God promised to give to Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:5-7; 17:8). ¶The Canaanites were the descendants of Canaan, the grandson of Noah through Ham (Genesis 10:18-19). They were known for their idolatry and wickedness, which led to God commanding the Israelites to drive them out of the land (Deuteronomy 20:17). The term &quot;Canaanite&quot; was also used to refer to merchants or traders (Job 41:6; Proverbs 31:24), possibly due to their reputation for trading. ¶After the Exodus, the Israelites conquered parts of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, but they failed to completely drive out the Canaanites (Judges 1:27-36). This led to ongoing conflicts and religious influences throughout Israel's history. The prophets often rebuked Israel for adopting Canaanite practices and worshipping their gods (Ezekiel 16:3).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Capernaum was a fishing village located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. It served as a base for Jesus' ministry in the region and is mentioned frequently in the Gospels. After being rejected in Nazareth, Jesus made Capernaum his home (Matthew 4:13) and performed many miracles there, including healing a centurion's servant (Matthew 8:5-13) and Peter's mother-in-law (Mark 1:29-31). ¶Jesus taught in the synagogue at Capernaum (Mark 1:21; John 6:59) and called several of his disciples, such as Peter, Andrew, James, and John, from the village (Mark 1:16-20). Despite the numerous miracles and teachings, the people of Capernaum did not repent, leading Jesus to rebuke the city for its unbelief (Matthew 11:23; Luke 10:15). ¶The ruins of ancient Capernaum have been excavated, revealing the remains of a synagogue dating to the 4th or 5th century AD, built on the foundation of an earlier synagogue from the time of Jesus. The site also includes the remains of a house that may have belonged to Peter.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Caphtor, identified as the island of Crete, was the original homeland of the Philistines and a place visited by the apostle Paul.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Caphtor, mentioned in the Old Testament, is generally identified as the island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. According to Amos 9:7, the Philistines originated from Caphtor, and Jeremiah 47:4 refers to &quot;the remnant of the country of Caphtor,&quot; linking the Philistines to this island. ¶In Deuteronomy 2:23, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, are described as destroying the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settling in their place. This suggests that the Philistines, who are known to have settled in the coastal region of Canaan, trace their ancestry back to Caphtor. ¶In the New Testament, Crete is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's travels. During his journey to Rome, Paul's ship sailed along the southern coast of Crete (Acts 27:7-13), and they sought to winter in the Cretan harbor of Phoenix (Acts 27:12). After the ship encountered a storm and was wrecked on the island of Malta, Paul continued his journey and eventually passed by Crete again (Acts 27:21). ¶Paul also left his companion Titus on Crete to organize the church and appoint elders in every town (Titus 1:5). In his letter to Titus, Paul quotes a Cretan prophet who described Cretans as &quot;always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons&quot; (Titus 1:12), indicating the challenges Titus faced in ministering to the people of Crete. ¶On the day of Pentecost, Cretans were among the people present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cappadocia was a region in Asia Minor where some early Christian believers lived.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cappadocia was an ancient region located in central Asia Minor, in modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned twice in the New Testament. In Acts 2:9, Cappadocians were among the people present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. This suggests that there were Jewish inhabitants from Cappadocia who had come to Jerusalem for the feast. ¶In 1 Peter 1:1, the apostle Peter addresses his letter to the &quot;pilgrims of the Dispersion,&quot; including those in Cappadocia, indicating the presence of Christian believers in the region. These believers were likely converts from the Jewish diaspora and Gentile proselytes. ¶Cappadocia was known for its unique geological features, including underground cities and rock-cut churches, many of which were used by early Christians as hiding places during times of persecution. The region played a significant role in the early history of Christianity and was home to several important church fathers, such as Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Carchemish was an ancient city on the Euphrates River where the Babylonians decisively defeated the Egyptians.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Carchemish was an important ancient city located on the Euphrates River, near the modern border between Syria and Turkey. It is mentioned three times in the Bible, all in the context of significant historical events. In 2 Chronicles 35:20, King Josiah of Judah confronted Pharaoh Necho of Egypt at Carchemish, resulting in Josiah's death. ¶Isaiah 10:9 mentions Carchemish as one of the cities conquered by the Assyrians, along with Calno, Arpad, Hamath, and Samaria, illustrating the extent of Assyrian power. In Jeremiah 46:2, the prophet describes the decisive battle at Carchemish between the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar and the Egyptians in 605 BC. The Babylonian victory marked the end of Egyptian influence in the region and the beginning of Babylonian supremacy. ¶Archaeologically, Carchemish has been identified with the modern site of Karkamış in southeastern Turkey. Excavations have revealed a rich history dating back to the Hittite Empire, with the city serving as an important center of trade and military power in the region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Carmel was a town in Judah, known as the home of Nabal and his wife Abigail, who later married David.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Carmel, also known as Racal, was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:55). It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in relation to David's life. Carmel was the home of Nabal, a wealthy but foolish man who refused to assist David and his men (1 Samuel 25:2-11). Nabal's wife, Abigail, intervened and provided for David's needs, demonstrating her wisdom and resourcefulness (1 Samuel 25:14-35). ¶After Nabal's death, David married Abigail, and she became one of his wives (1 Samuel 25:40-42). Later, when David was fleeing from Saul, he sent his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, to stay in Carmel (1 Samuel 27:3). The town is also mentioned in the list of places that received spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites (1 Samuel 30:29). ¶In the Song of Solomon, the beauty of the bride's head is compared to Mount Carmel (Song of Solomon 7:5), likely referring to the lush vegetation and majesty of the mountain. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Nahum use Carmel as a symbol of fertility, beauty, and God's judgment (Isaiah 33:9, 35:2; Jeremiah 46:18, 50:19; Amos 1:2, 9:3; Nahum 1:4).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Carmel was a mountain range in northern Israel where the prophet Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Carmel is a mountain range stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the southeast, located in northern Israel. It is most famously associated with the prophet Elijah and his confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:19-40). On Mount Carmel, Elijah challenged the people of Israel to choose between the Lord and Baal, and he demonstrated the power of the true God by calling down fire from heaven. ¶After the contest, Elijah slaughtered the prophets of Baal at the Brook Kishon (1 Kings 18:40) and then went to the top of Mount Carmel to pray for rain, ending a three-year drought (1 Kings 18:42-45). The mountain is also mentioned in 2 Kings 2:25 and 4:25, in connection with the prophet Elisha, who was Elijah's successor. ¶Mount Carmel's lush vegetation and beauty made it a symbol of fertility and God's blessing in the Bible (Isaiah 35:2; Jeremiah 50:19; Amos 9:3). The mountain's strategic location and natural resources also made it a place of military and political significance throughout history.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Casiphia was a place in Babylon where Ezra sent for Levites to join the returning exiles in Jerusalem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Casiphia is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Ezra 8:17, as a place in Babylon where Levites were recruited to join the exiles returning to Jerusalem. During the reign of the Persian king Artaxerxes, Ezra led a group of Jews back to Jerusalem to restore worship at the temple. At the river Ahava, Ezra discovered that there were no Levites among the returning exiles (Ezra 8:15). ¶Ezra then sent a delegation to Casiphia, where a man named Iddo was the leader, to request that Levites be sent to join the returning group (Ezra 8:17). In response to this request, a number of Levites and temple servants were sent from Casiphia to accompany Ezra and the other exiles to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:18-20). ¶The exact location of Casiphia is unknown, but it was likely a settlement in Babylon where a community of Levites lived during the exile. This passage highlights the importance of the Levites in the restoration of temple worship and the care taken by Ezra to ensure that all the necessary personnel were present for the proper functioning of the temple in Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Cauda, also known as Clauda or Gavdos, is mentioned once in the Bible, in Acts 27:16. During Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner, the ship he was on encountered a severe storm. As they were being driven along by the wind, they passed to the south of a small island called Cauda. ¶The crew used this brief respite from the storm to secure the ship's lifeboat and undergird the ship with ropes to strengthen it against the battering waves (Acts 27:16-17). This measure was taken to prevent the ship from being run aground on the nearby Syrtis Sands, a notorious sandbar off the coast of North Africa. ¶Cauda is a small island located south of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. It provided a brief moment of shelter for Paul's ship during the storm, allowing the crew to make necessary preparations before continuing their perilous journey to Rome.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cenchreae was the eastern port of Corinth, where Paul had his hair cut in connection with a vow, and was the home of Phoebe, a deaconess of the church.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cenchreae was a seaport located on the eastern side of the Isthmus of Corinth, about seven miles from the city of Corinth. It served as the port for Corinth's trade with Asia Minor and the East. Cenchreae is mentioned twice in the Bible, both in connection with Paul's ministry. ¶In Acts 18:18, Paul departed from Corinth and sailed from Cenchreae to Syria, after having his hair cut due to a vow he had taken. This vow was likely a Nazirite vow (Numbers 6:1-21), which involved abstaining from cutting one's hair until the vow was completed. Paul's actions at Cenchreae indicate his continued observance of Jewish customs and his commitment to his Jewish heritage. ¶In Romans 16:1-2, Paul commends Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchreae, to the believers in Rome. He describes her as a servant of the church and a benefactor to many, including Paul himself. This passage provides insight into the role of women in the early church and their significant contributions to the spread of the gospel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chaldea was an ancient Mesopotamian empire, known for its astrologers and wise men, that played a significant role in the history of Israel, particularly during the Babylonian exile.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chaldea, also known as Babylonia, was an ancient empire located in southern Mesopotamia, in the region of modern-day Iraq. The Chaldeans were known for their expertise in astrology, astronomy, and other forms of wisdom. In the Bible, the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;Babylonian&quot; or to refer specifically to astrologers and wise men from Babylon. ¶The Chaldeans played a significant role in the history of Israel, particularly during the Babylonian exile. In 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, conquered Judah and deported many of its inhabitants to Chaldea (2 Kings 24:1-2). The prophet Jeremiah warned the people of Judah about the impending Chaldean invasion and the 70-year exile that would follow (Jeremiah 25:11-12). ¶During the exile, some Jews, such as Daniel and his companions, were chosen to serve in the Chaldean court due to their wisdom and knowledge (Daniel 1:3-4). The Chaldeans are also mentioned in connection with the interpretation of dreams and visions (Daniel 2:2-10; 4:7; 5:7-11). ¶The Chaldeans were also known for their military might and their role in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10). However, the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah foretold the eventual downfall of Chaldea at the hands of the Medes and Persians (Isaiah 13:19; 47:1-5; Jeremiah 50:1-51:64).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Chebar River was a waterway in Babylonia near which the prophet Ezekiel received visions from God during the Babylonian exile.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Chebar River, also known as the Kebar River, is mentioned several times in the Book of Ezekiel. It was a waterway located in Babylonia, near the city of Nippur, where the prophet Ezekiel and other Jewish exiles were settled during the Babylonian captivity. ¶Ezekiel received his prophetic call and many of his visions while residing by the Chebar River (Ezekiel 1:1, 3). It was there that he saw the vision of the four living creatures and the throne of God (Ezekiel 1:1-28). Later, Ezekiel was transported in visions to Jerusalem, where he witnessed the idolatry and abominations being committed in the temple (Ezekiel 8:1-18). ¶The Chebar River is also mentioned in connection with the elders of Judah who came to consult Ezekiel (Ezekiel 3:15) and the vision of the cherubim and the glory of God departing from the temple (Ezekiel 10:15-22). ¶The exact location of the Chebar River is uncertain, but it was likely a navigable canal or tributary of the Euphrates River. The settlement of Jewish exiles by the river suggests that it was an area suitable for agriculture and sustaining a population. The Chebar River serves as an important geographical marker in Ezekiel's prophecies and provides the setting for many of his visions and messages from God.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chephirah was one of the Gibeonite towns that became part of the territories of Benjamin and Judah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chephirah was one of the four Gibeonite cities, along with Gibeon, Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim, that deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them (Joshua 9:17). The Gibeonites, fearing destruction by the Israelites, sent ambassadors disguised as travelers from a distant land to seek a covenant of peace. Joshua and the leaders of Israel made a treaty with them without consulting the Lord, only to discover later that the Gibeonites were actually their neighbors. ¶As a result of the treaty, the Gibeonites were spared but were assigned to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and the altar of the Lord (Joshua 9:27). Chephirah, along with the other Gibeonite cities, was initially allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:26) but later became part of the territory of Judah. ¶After the Babylonian exile, the descendants of the Gibeonites, including those from Chephirah, returned to their cities and were counted among the people of Israel (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). The town's mention in these post-exilic records indicates that it was still inhabited and recognized as a distinct community during the Persian period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Brook Cherith was where the prophet Elijah hid and was fed by ravens during a drought in Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Brook Cherith is mentioned in the story of the prophet Elijah during the reign of King Ahab of Israel (1 Kings 17:3-5). After Elijah declared a drought in the land as a judgment from God, the Lord instructed him to hide by the Brook Cherith, east of the Jordan River. God promised to provide for Elijah there, using ravens to bring him bread and meat in the morning and evening, and the brook as his source of water. ¶Elijah obeyed and stayed by the Brook Cherith until it dried up due to the prolonged drought. The exact location of the brook is uncertain, but it was likely one of the many wadis or seasonal streams that flowed into the Jordan River from the mountains of Gilead. ¶This event demonstrates God's faithfulness in providing for His servant during a time of hardship and judgment. It also highlights Elijah's obedience and trust in God's direction and provision. The Brook Cherith served as a place of refuge and sustenance for Elijah, preparing him for his subsequent confrontations with Ahab and the prophets of Baal.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cherub was a place in Babylonia from which some Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cherub is mentioned twice in the Bible, both in the context of the return of Jewish exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity (Ezra 2:59; Nehemiah 7:61). In these passages, Cherub is listed along with other places, such as Tel-melah and Tel-harsha, as the hometowns of some of the returning exiles. ¶These exiles were unable to prove their lineage as Israelites or to trace their ancestry to specific families. This suggests that during the Babylonian captivity, some Jews may have settled in Cherub and other nearby towns, and over time, their family records were lost or destroyed. ¶The exact location of Cherub is unknown, but it was likely a small town or village in Babylonia, where a community of Jewish exiles had lived during the captivity. The name &quot;Cherub&quot; may be derived from the Akkadian word &quot;kāribu,&quot; which means &quot;intercessor&quot; or &quot;one who blesses,&quot; possibly indicating a religious significance of the town in Babylonian culture. ¶The mention of Cherub in the lists of returning exiles highlights the challenges faced by some Jews in proving their heritage and the diversity of locations from which they returned to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chesalon, also known as Mount Jearim, was a landmark on the northern boundary of Judah, near Bethshemesh.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chesalon, also referred to as Mount Jearim, was a place mentioned as one of the landmarks on the western part of the northern boundary of Judah (Joshua 15:10). It was situated beyond Mount Seir and was apparently located on the shoulder or side of Mount Jearim, which means &quot;Mount of Forests.&quot; Although Mount Jearim was in close proximity to Kirjath-jearim, the two were not necessarily connected. ¶Chesalon was the next landmark after Bethshemesh in the description of Judah's border. The exact location is uncertain, but it has been identified with the modern village of Kesla, located about six miles northeast of Ain Shems (Bethshemesh) in the western mountains of Judah. In the 4th century AD, Eusebius and Jerome described Chesalon as a very large village. ¶The name Chesalon may be derived from the Hebrew verb &quot;kasal,&quot; which can mean &quot;to be confident,&quot; often in a foolish or stupid way. However, due to the lack of context, the exact meaning and significance of the name remain unclear.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Chesulloth, also referred to as Chisloth-tabor or Tabor, was a town located on the border between the territories of Issachar and Zebulun (Joshua 19:12, 18). It is mentioned in the description of the boundaries of these two tribes during the division of the Promised Land. ¶The town's association with Tabor suggests that it was situated near Mount Tabor, a prominent landmark in the region. Mount Tabor is known for its strategic location and its role in various biblical events, such as Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera (Judges 4-5). ¶In 1 Chronicles 6:77, Tabor is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites from the tribe of Zebulun, along with its common-land. This indicates that Chesulloth, or a portion of it, was allocated to the Levites for their use and sustenance. ¶The exact location of Chesulloth is uncertain, but its proximity to Mount Tabor and its position on the border between Issachar and Zebulun suggest that it was a significant settlement in the region during the time of Joshua and the early Israelite period.</ext_description>

In this passage, Ezekiel prophesies about the destruction of Tyre and lists various nations and cities that traded with it, including Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad. ¶The exact location of Chilmad is unknown, and there is little information about it outside of this single reference in Ezekiel. It is possible that Chilmad was a city or region in Mesopotamia, as it is mentioned alongside other places in that area, such as Haran and Asshur. ¶The context of the passage suggests that Chilmad was known for its trade and commercial activities, as it is listed among the merchants and suppliers of Tyre. However, the specific goods or products that Chilmad traded are not mentioned in the text. ¶Given the limited information available, Chilmad appears to have been a place of some commercial significance during the time of Ezekiel, but its precise location and role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network remain uncertain.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chinnereth, also known as the Sea of Galilee or the Sea of Tiberias, is a freshwater lake in northern Israel where Jesus conducted much of his ministry.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chinnereth, Chinneroth, the Sea of Galilee, and the Sea of Tiberias are different names used in the Bible to refer to the largest freshwater lake in Israel. The lake is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, fed by the Jordan River, and is approximately 13 miles (21 kilometers) long and 8 miles (13 kilometers) wide. ¶In the Old Testament, the lake is referred to as the Sea of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 13:27) or Chinneroth (Joshua 12:3), likely named after a nearby town. The name &quot;Chinnereth&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word for &quot;harp,&quot; possibly referring to the shape of the lake. ¶In the New Testament, the lake is most commonly known as the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18; Mark 1:16; John 6:1) and is the setting for many events in Jesus' life and ministry. Jesus called his first disciples, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, while they were fishing on the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18-22). He also calmed a storm on the lake (Mark 4:35-41), walked on its waters (John 6:16-21), and appeared to his disciples on its shores after his resurrection (John 21:1-14). ¶The lake is also referred to as the Sea of Tiberias (John 6:1; 21:1), named after the city of Tiberias, which was founded on its western shore during the reign of Herod Antipas (circa 20 CE). The city was named in honor of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. ¶The Sea of Galilee was an important source of livelihood for the people in the region, with fishing being a major industry. Several of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were fishermen on the lake (Luke 5:1-11). The lake's shores were also dotted with numerous towns and villages, such as Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Magdala, which feature prominently in the Gospels.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chinneroth, also known as Chinnereth, was a region and a city near the Sea of Galilee, which was also called the Sea of Chinnereth.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chinneroth, or Chinnereth, is mentioned in the Bible as both a region and a city located near the Sea of Galilee, which was also known as the Sea of Chinnereth or the Lake of Gennesaret. In Joshua 11:2, Chinneroth is listed as one of the areas where the kings of the northern Canaanite cities gathered to fight against Joshua and the Israelites. ¶In Joshua 19:35, Chinnereth is mentioned as one of the fortified cities allotted to the tribe of Naphtali during the division of the Promised Land. This suggests that Chinnereth was a significant city in the region during the time of the conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The Sea of Chinnereth, later known as the Sea of Galilee, was named after the city or region of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Deuteronomy 3:17). This sea played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus Christ, as he performed many miracles and taught in the towns and villages along its shores. ¶In 1 Kings 15:20, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, attacked several cities in northern Israel, including &quot;all Chinneroth,&quot; referring to the region around the Sea of Galilee. This event demonstrates the strategic importance of the Chinneroth region in the geopolitical landscape of ancient Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chios was an island in the Aegean Sea where Paul's ship stopped during his journey to Jerusalem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chios is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Acts 20:15, as one of the stops on Paul's journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem. After leaving Troas, Paul and his companions sailed to Samothrace, then to Neapolis, and finally arrived at Chios. ¶Chios is an island located in the Aegean Sea, off the coast of modern-day Turkey. It was known for its strategic location along the shipping routes between Asia Minor and Greece. The island was famous for its wine production and its cultivation of mastic, a resin used for medicinal purposes and as a spice. ¶In Paul's time, Chios was part of the Roman Empire and had a significant Jewish population. The brief mention of Chios in the book of Acts suggests that it was a regular stop for ships navigating the Aegean Sea and that Paul's journey followed the established maritime trade routes of the time. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any further details about Paul's activities or experiences on Chios, the island's inclusion in the account of his journey highlights the geographical scope of his travels and the spread of the early Christian church throughout the Mediterranean world.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Chitlish is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 15:40, as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Shephelah region. The Shephelah was a lowland area between the coastal plain and the Judean hills, known for its fertile soil and strategic importance. ¶The exact location of Chitlish is unknown, and there is no further information about the town in the Bible. Its inclusion in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement during the time of Joshua and the division of the Promised Land. ¶The name Chitlish may be derived from the Hebrew root &quot;chatal,&quot; which means &quot;to take away&quot; or &quot;to snatch.&quot; However, without additional context, the meaning and significance of the town's name remain uncertain. ¶Given the limited biblical information, Chitlish appears to have been a small town in the Shephelah region of Judah, but its precise location, history, and role in the life of the Israelites are not elaborated upon in the text.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Chorazin was a town in Galilee that Jesus rebuked for its lack of repentance despite the mighty works he had done there.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Chorazin was a town located in Galilee, near the Sea of Galilee, during the time of Jesus Christ's ministry. It is mentioned twice in the Gospels, both in the context of Jesus pronouncing judgment on the town for its unbelief and lack of repentance (Matthew 11:21; Luke 10:13). ¶In these passages, Jesus contrasts Chorazin with the Gentile cities of Tyre and Sidon, stating that if the mighty works he had performed in Chorazin had been done in those cities, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. This suggests that Jesus had carried out significant miracles and teachings in Chorazin, yet the people remained unresponsive to his message. ¶Jesus then declares that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for Chorazin, emphasizing the severity of the town's spiritual hardness and the consequences of rejecting the Messiah. ¶The exact location of Chorazin is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be the modern-day site of Khirbet Karazeh, about 2.5 miles north of Capernaum. Archaeological excavations at the site have revealed the remains of a synagogue from the 3rd or 4th century AD, as well as residential buildings and streets. ¶Chorazin serves as a sobering example of the consequences of unbelief and the importance of responding to Jesus' teachings and miracles with faith and repentance.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cilicia, a province in southeast Asia Minor, was the birthplace of Paul and an area where he ministered to the early churches.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cilicia was a province located in the southeastern region of Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey. It was bounded by the Taurus Mountains to the north, separating it from Cappadocia, Lycaonia, and Isauria, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, Syria to the east, and Pamphylia to the west. ¶In the New Testament, Cilicia is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul. Paul was born in Tarsus, one of the chief cities of Cilicia (Acts 21:39; 22:3). After his conversion, Paul spent some time in Cilicia (Galatians 1:21; Acts 9:30) and later revisited the region during his second missionary journey, strengthening the churches (Acts 15:41). ¶Cilicia had a significant Jewish population, and the synagogue of the Cilicians in Jerusalem was among those who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). The early Christian church spread to Cilicia, as evidenced by the letter addressed to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (Acts 15:23). ¶Geographically, Cilicia was an important region, serving as a major trade route between Syria and the west. The Cilician Gates, a mountain pass through the Taurus Mountains, was a strategic point of travel and was likely used by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journeys (Acts 15:41).</ext_description>

This wilderness area was located in the eastern part of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah, near the Dead Sea. ¶The exact location of the City of Salt is unknown, but its proximity to the Dead Sea suggests that it may have been involved in the production or trade of salt. The Dead Sea, also known as the Salt Sea, is known for its high salt content, and salt was a valuable commodity in ancient times, used for preserving food and other purposes. ¶Apart from its inclusion in the list of towns in the wilderness of Judah, no other information is provided about the City of Salt in the Bible. Its mention in Joshua 15 indicates that it was a recognized settlement during the time of the conquest and division of the Promised Land.</ext_description>

It is mentioned once in the Bible, in Acts 27:7, in the context of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner. ¶After setting sail from Myra, the ship carrying Paul and other prisoners encountered difficulty sailing due to unfavorable winds. They sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Unable to continue sailing westward, they turned south and sailed along the sheltered side of Crete. ¶Cnidus was known for its strategic location, with two harbors providing shelter from various wind directions. The city was also famous for its sculpture, particularly the Aphrodite of Cnidus, a renowned work by the sculptor Praxiteles. ¶The mention of Cnidus in Acts 27 provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions during their journey to Rome and the challenges they faced while navigating the Mediterranean Sea. It also demonstrates the apostle's determination to reach Rome, despite the difficulties and dangers encountered along the way.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Colossae was a city in the region of Phrygia in Asia Minor, to which Paul addressed one of his epistles.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Colossae was an ancient city located in the Lycus Valley in the region of Phrygia, in western Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is most notably known as the recipient of one of Paul's epistles, the Letter to the Colossians. ¶In the opening of the epistle (Colossians 1:2), Paul addresses the letter to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colossae. The church in Colossae was likely established during Paul's third missionary journey, as he spent two years teaching in Ephesus, and the gospel spread throughout the region (Acts 19:10). ¶Although Paul had not personally visited Colossae (Colossians 2:1), he had heard about the faith and love of the Colossian believers through Epaphras, who was likely the founder of the church (Colossians 1:7-8). Epaphras had informed Paul of some concerns regarding false teachings that were influencing the Colossian church, prompting Paul to write the epistle. ¶In the letter, Paul emphasizes the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ, warning against false philosophies and human traditions that could lead believers astray (Colossians 2:8-23). He also provides practical instructions for Christian living, including relationships within families and between slaves and masters (Colossians 3:1-4:6). ¶The closing of the letter (Colossians 4:18) includes a personal greeting from Paul, written in his own hand, and a request for the Colossians to exchange letters with the church in Laodicea, another nearby city. ¶Colossae was known for its wool and dye industry, particularly a unique purple dye called colossinus. The city was also located near the important trade routes that connected Ephesus to the Euphrates River. However, by the time of Paul's writing, Colossae had declined in importance compared to the nearby cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Corban refers to an offering dedicated to God, which the Pharisees used to avoid supporting their parents, and also to the temple treasury.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Corban is a term that appears in the New Testament with two related meanings. In Mark 7:11, Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for using the concept of Corban to avoid their responsibility to support their parents. The Pharisees would declare their property or assets as &quot;Corban,&quot; meaning it was dedicated to God, and thus exempt from being used to help their parents, even though they could still benefit from it themselves. Jesus condemns this practice as a way of nullifying God's commandment to honor one's father and mother. ¶The term Corban is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;qorban,&quot; which means &quot;offering&quot; or &quot;sacrifice.&quot; In the Old Testament, it refers to various offerings and sacrifices brought to the temple as an act of worship and devotion to God. ¶In Matthew 27:6, the term Corban appears again, this time referring to the temple treasury. After Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver he had received for betraying Jesus, the chief priests decided that it was not lawful to put the money into the treasury (Corban) because it was the price of blood. This indicates that the temple treasury was considered sacred, and there were regulations concerning the source and use of funds placed in it.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Corinth, an important city in ancient Greece, was the location of a Christian church to which Paul wrote two epistles.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Corinth was a prominent city in ancient Greece, located on the Isthmus of Corinth, which connects the Peloponnese to the mainland. It was known for its strategic location, controlling trade routes between the Aegean and Adriatic seas. The city was famous for its wealth, luxury, and immorality. ¶In the New Testament, Corinth plays a significant role as the location of a Christian church founded by the apostle Paul during his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1-18). Paul spent 18 months in Corinth, working as a tentmaker and preaching the gospel. Many Corinthians, including Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed and were baptized (Acts 18:8). ¶After leaving Corinth, Paul wrote two epistles to the church, known as 1 and 2 Corinthians. These letters address various issues faced by the Corinthian believers, including divisions, immorality, lawsuits, and questions about spiritual gifts, resurrection, and Christian conduct. ¶In Romans 16:27, Paul sends greetings to the Corinthians, indicating that he wrote the epistle to the Romans while in Corinth. In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Erastus in Corinth, suggesting that the city continued to have a Christian presence. ¶Throughout the epistles, Paul refers to the Corinthian believers with affection, calling them &quot;saints&quot; (1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:1) and expressing his love for them (2 Corinthians 6:11; 13:13-14). The correspondence between Paul and the Corinthian church provides valuable insights into the challenges and growth of the early Christian community in a significant Gentile city.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Corner Gate was a fortified gate in Jerusalem's wall, mentioned in connection with repairs and measurements of the city.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Corner Gate was one of the gates in the wall surrounding Jerusalem during the period of the Divided Kingdom and the post-exilic era. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in connection with repairs made to the city's fortifications and measurements of the city's perimeter. ¶In 2 Kings 14:13 and 2 Chronicles 25:23, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the points from which King Jehoash of Israel broke down the wall of Jerusalem after defeating King Amaziah of Judah. This suggests that the Corner Gate was a significant and strategic point in the city's defenses. ¶During the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, the Corner Gate was fortified and towers were built near it (2 Chronicles 26:9). This further emphasizes the gate's importance in the city's defensive structure. ¶In the book of Jeremiah, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the landmarks in the prophetic description of Jerusalem's future restoration (Jeremiah 31:38). This passage envisions a time when the city will be rebuilt and expanded, with the Corner Gate marking one of the boundaries of the renewed city. ¶The exact location of the Corner Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated at a point where the city wall turned a corner, hence its name. Some scholars suggest that it may have been located near the northwest corner of the city, possibly close to the present-day Jaffa Gate.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cos was an island in the Aegean Sea where Paul's ship stopped during his return journey to Jerusalem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cos, also known as Kos, is an island in the Aegean Sea, located off the coast of ancient Caria in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is mentioned once in the Bible, in Acts 21:1, as one of the stops on Paul's return journey to Jerusalem after his third missionary journey. ¶After leaving Miletus, where Paul had met with the elders of the Ephesian church (Acts 20:17-38), he and his companions set sail and came to Cos. The next day, they went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. This brief mention of Cos provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions as they navigated the islands of the Aegean Sea. ¶Cos was known in ancient times for its strategic location, fertile land, and medical school associated with Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician. The island was also a center of the worship of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities or experiences on Cos, the mention of the island in the context of his journey demonstrates the apostle's determination to return to Jerusalem, despite the warnings he had received about the hardships that awaited him there (Acts 20:22-23; 21:4, 11-14). The inclusion of Cos in the itinerary also highlights the extensive travel and maritime connections in the ancient Mediterranean world, which facilitated the spread of the gospel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cushan, a location mentioned in Habakkuk 3:7, is possibly related to Cush or another unidentified place.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cushan is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Habakkuk 3:7, where it is listed alongside the &quot;tents of Midian&quot; in a passage describing the prophet Habakkuk's vision of God's judgment. The verse reads, &quot;I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.&quot; ¶The exact location and identity of Cushan are uncertain, as there is no other mention of it in the Bible or other historical sources. Some scholars suggest that Cushan might be related to Cush, the ancient region in Africa, due to the similarity in names. Others propose that it could be a reference to a Midianite tribe or another unidentified location. ¶Given the limited information available, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about Cushan. However, its mention alongside Midian in the context of God's judgment suggests that it may have been a place or people group that experienced divine punishment or was affected by the events described in Habakkuk's vision.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Cuthah was a Babylonian city from which the Assyrian king brought people to settle in Samaria after the deportation of the Israelites.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Cuthah, also known as Cuth, was a city in Babylonia from which the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V (or possibly Sargon II) brought people to settle in the cities of Samaria after the deportation of the Israelites (2 Kings 17:24). This event occurred around 722 BC when the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and exiled a significant portion of its population. ¶The people of Cuthah, along with those from other Babylonian cities such as Babylon, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, were relocated to Samaria. These settlers, who came to be known as the Samaritans, initially did not worship the Lord and instead continued to serve their own gods (2 Kings 17:29-31). ¶In response to the settlers' lack of reverence for the Lord, God sent lions among them, which killed some of the people. When the king of Assyria was informed of this, he ordered that one of the priests from among the exiled Israelites be sent back to Samaria to teach the new inhabitants about the God of the land (2 Kings 17:25-28). ¶As a result, the Samaritans developed a syncretic religion, combining elements of their own beliefs with the worship of the Lord (2 Kings 17:32-34, 41). This mixed religious practice led to ongoing tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile, as evidenced in the New Testament (e.g., John 4:9). ¶The mention of Cuthah in the Bible provides insight into the complex history of the Samaritan people and the religious and cultural dynamics that shaped the region after the Assyrian conquest of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Cyprus is an island located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, known in the Bible by various names, including Kittim and Elishah. In the Old Testament, the island is mentioned in the context of trade and prophecy. Isaiah 23:1, 12 and Jeremiah 2:10 refer to the ships of Kittim, indicating the island's involvement in maritime trade. Ezekiel 27:6 mentions the use of ivory from the coasts of Elishah (possibly Cyprus) in the construction of ships. ¶In Numbers 24:24 and Daniel 11:30, Kittim is associated with ships that come against the people of God, possibly referring to the island's role in military campaigns or as a base for hostile forces. ¶In the New Testament, Cyprus plays a significant role in the spread of early Christianity. The apostle Barnabas, a Levite from Cyprus (Acts 4:36), and some unnamed believers from the island were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch (Acts 11:19-20). Barnabas and Saul (Paul) visited Cyprus during their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4), where they encountered the sorcerer Elymas and converted the proconsul Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-12). ¶Later, Barnabas and Mark sailed to Cyprus after a disagreement with Paul (Acts 15:39). Paul also visited the island during his third missionary journey (Acts 21:3) and during his journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:4). ¶The early Christian community in Cyprus included Mnason, an early disciple who provided lodging for Paul and his companions in Jerusalem (Acts 21:16).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Cyrene was an important city in ancient Libya, located in present-day Libya. In the New Testament, Cyrene is mentioned in connection with several individuals who played a role in the life of Jesus and the early Christian church. ¶Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus' cross on the way to His crucifixion, is mentioned in Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21, and Luke 23:26. Mark's Gospel identifies Simon as the father of Alexander and Rufus, suggesting that these men may have been known to the early Christian community. ¶In Acts 2:10, Cyrenians are listed among the people present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples. Some of these Cyrenian Jews, along with those from Cyprus, were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch (Acts 11:20). ¶Lucius of Cyrene is mentioned as one of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch who ministered to the Lord and fasted, leading to the commissioning of Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for their first missionary journey (Acts 13:1). ¶In Acts 6:9, Cyrenian Jews are mentioned as part of the Synagogue of the Freedmen, which disputed with Stephen, the first Christian martyr. ¶These references to Cyrene in the New Testament highlight the city's significance as a center of Jewish diaspora and its contribution to the spread of early Christianity, particularly in the evangelization of Gentiles.</ext_description>

Its inclusion in the border description of Zebulun's territory suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of Joshua and the conquest of Canaan. ¶The meaning of the name Dabbesheth is uncertain, and the lack of additional information in the Bible or other historical sources makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the town's role or character.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Daberath was a city located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Issachar (Joshua 19:12) during the division of the Promised Land. It is mentioned as one of the border cities of Issachar, along with Chisloth-tabor and Japhia. ¶In Joshua 21:28 and 1 Chronicles 6:72, Daberath is listed as one of the cities given to the Levites of the Gershonite clan from the tribe of Issachar, along with its pasturelands. This indicates that Daberath, or a portion of it, was set apart for the Levites, who were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle service and teaching the law to the people. ¶The exact location of Daberath is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the modern village of Daburiyya, located at the base of Mount Tabor in Lower Galilee. This identification is supported by the similarity in name and the geographical context provided by the biblical references. ¶Apart from its designation as a Levitical city and its location on the border of Issachar's territory, no other details are provided about Daberath in the Bible. Its inclusion in the lists of cities and boundaries suggests that it was a recognized settlement during the time of Joshua and the early Israelite period, but its specific history and significance remain unknown.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Dalmatia, a region in Illyricum where Titus traveled (2 Timothy 4:10).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Dalmatia was a region located on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, in what is now Croatia. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in 2 Timothy 4:10, where Paul writes that Titus has gone to Dalmatia. This suggests that Dalmatia was a place where early Christian missionaries traveled to spread the gospel. Dalmatia was part of the Roman province of Illyricum, which was known for its rugged terrain and fierce tribes. Despite the challenges, Paul and his associates were committed to sharing the message of Christ throughout the region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Damascus, an ancient city in Syria, played a significant role in biblical history.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, serving as the capital of Syria. It is first mentioned in Genesis 14:15 in connection with Abraham's rescue of Lot. Later, David brought the city under Israelite control (2 Samuel 8:5-6), but it regained its independence during Solomon's reign (1 Kings 11:24). Damascus was involved in conflicts with Israel and Judah, often aligning with their enemies (1 Kings 15:18; 2 Kings 16:9). The city was known for its beauty and prosperity, with references to its fertile gardens and bustling trade (Song of Solomon 7:4; Ezekiel 27:18). In the New Testament, Damascus is significant as the place of Paul's conversion on the road to the city (Acts 9:1-19). The city played a crucial role in the early spread of Christianity, with Paul spending time there after his conversion (Galatians 1:17).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Dan, an Israelite tribe and a city in northern Israel, formerly called Laish or Leshem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Dan was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's fifth son, Dan (Genesis 30:6). The tribe was allotted territory in the northern part of Canaan (Joshua 19:40-48). The city of Dan, originally known as Laish or Leshem, was conquered by the Danites (Joshua 19:47; Judges 18:29). It became the northernmost city of Israel, often used in the phrase &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot; to describe the entire land (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20). Jeroboam set up one of his golden calves in Dan (1 Kings 12:29-30), leading to idolatry. The city was also known for its skilled craftsmen (2 Chronicles 2:14). Dan was one of the first places to fall to foreign invaders due to its northern location (Jeremiah 4:15; 8:16).</ext_description>

It was conquered by Joshua during the initial Israelite conquest of Canaan (Joshua 10:38-39; 11:21; 12:13). Later, Caleb offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would capture Debir, and Othniel, Caleb's nephew, successfully took the city (Joshua 15:15-16; Judges 1:11-12). The city was also known as Kiriath-sannah, meaning &quot;city of palm,&quot; and Kiriath-sepher, meaning &quot;city of books,&quot; possibly indicating it was a center of learning. After its capture, Debir was allotted to the priests (Joshua 21:15; 1 Chronicles 6:58).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Decapolis was a group of ten Hellenistic cities located in ancient Palestine, primarily in modern-day Jordan, Syria, and Israel. The cities were centers of Greek culture and were granted a degree of autonomy under Roman rule. In the New Testament, the Decapolis is mentioned as a region where Jesus traveled and performed miracles (Matthew 4:25; Mark 5:20; 7:31). The most notable event connected to the Decapolis is the healing of the demon-possessed man in the region of the Gerasenes (Mark 5:1-20). After being healed, the man went throughout the Decapolis proclaiming what Jesus had done for him, spreading the message of Christ in the region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Dedan was an Arabian people and region, known for their involvement in trade.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Dedan was an Arabian people and region, mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments. They were descendants of Abraham through his wife Keturah (Genesis 25:3). The Dedanites were known for their involvement in trade, particularly in luxury goods such as ivory, ebony, and precious cloths (Ezekiel 27:15, 20). The region of Dedan was likely located in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, near Edom. The Dedanites are mentioned in prophetic oracles concerning God's judgment against the nations (Jeremiah 25:23; 49:8; Ezekiel 25:13; 38:13), indicating their significance in the ancient Near East. In Isaiah 21:13, a prophecy is directed to the caravans of Dedanites, warning them of impending danger, further emphasizing their role in trade and travel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Dibon, also called Dibon-gad, was a city located in the region of Moab, north of the Arnon River. It was originally inhabited by the Moabites (Numbers 21:30) but was later conquered by the Israelites and allotted to the tribe of Gad (Numbers 32:3, 34; Joshua 13:9, 17). The Gadites rebuilt and fortified the city (Numbers 32:34). However, Dibon was later repossessed by the Moabites (Isaiah 15:2; Jeremiah 48:18, 22). The city is mentioned in the famous Mesha Stele (Moabite Stone), which records the victories of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. Dibon is also associated with the &quot;waters of Dimon&quot; in Isaiah 15:9, possibly referring to a nearby river or stream. The city was one of the stopping points during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings (Numbers 33:45-46).</ext_description>

It was likely a prominent tree used by pagan diviners for their occult practices.

The mention of this tree suggests that pagan divination practices were still prevalent in the region during the time of the judges. The Diviners' Oak stands as a reminder of the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God in the face of surrounding pagan influences.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Dor, also known as Naphath-dor, was a Canaanite city allotted to Manasseh but not fully conquered (Joshua 12:23; 17:11; Judges 1:27).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Dor, also referred to as Naphath-dor, was a Canaanite city located on the Mediterranean coast, south of Mount Carmel. It was one of the cities conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of Canaan (Joshua 12:23) and was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance (Joshua 17:11; 1 Chronicles 7:29). However, the Manassites were unable to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Dor, and the city remained under Canaanite control (Judges 1:27). During the reign of Solomon, Dor was included in the administrative district governed by Ben-abinadab, one of Solomon's officers (1 Kings 4:11). The city was known for its strategic location and its involvement in maritime trade. Archaeological excavations at Tel Dor have revealed evidence of the city's long history and its importance as a port city in ancient times.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Dothan was a place located in the territory of Israel, mentioned in two significant events in the Bible. First, it was the place where Joseph found his brothers tending their flocks after being sent by his father, Jacob (Genesis 37:17). It was near Dothan that Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery to a caravan of Ishmaelites traveling to Egypt. Later, during the time of the prophet Elisha, the king of Aram sent his army to capture Elisha at Dothan (2 Kings 6:13). God protected Elisha by revealing the presence of heavenly chariots and horses surrounding the city. Dothan was located near the major trade routes between Egypt and Mesopotamia, making it a strategic location for both commercial and military purposes.</ext_description>

During Nehemiah's nighttime survey of the damaged walls of Jerusalem, he passed by the Dragon Spring on his way to the Valley Gate and the King's Pool. The exact location of the Dragon Spring is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the eastern side of the city, possibly near the Kidron Valley. The name &quot;Dragon Spring&quot; may refer to the shape of the water source or to a decorative dragon-like structure associated with it. The mention of the Dragon Spring highlights the importance of water sources for ancient Jerusalem and the need to secure them as part of the city's defenses.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Dumah, mentioned in Isaiah 21:11, was a city or region located in Arabia, likely in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The name &quot;Dumah&quot; means &quot;silence&quot; or &quot;stillness&quot; in Hebrew. In the prophetic oracle, a watchman from Dumah calls out to the prophet Isaiah, asking about the night and the coming of the morning. Isaiah's response is cryptic, indicating that while morning is coming, the night will also return. This oracle is part of a series of prophecies concerning various nations, and it suggests that Dumah, like other nations, would face God's judgment. The exact identity and location of Dumah in this context are uncertain, but it was likely a significant city or region in ancient Arabia.</ext_description>

During Nehemiah's inspection of the damaged walls of Jerusalem, he passed through the Dung Gate on his way to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool (Nehemiah 2:13). The Dung Gate was later repaired by Malchijah, the son of Rechab, as part of the rebuilding efforts led by Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:14). In the dedication ceremony of the rebuilt wall, one of the two choirs processing around the city passed by the Dung Gate on their way to the Temple (Nehemiah 12:31).</ext_description>

The name &quot;Dura&quot; is of Akkadian origin and means &quot;walled place&quot; or &quot;fortress.&quot; Nebuchadnezzar's decision to erect the statue in Dura may have been influenced by the plain's proximity to Babylon and its suitability for large gatherings. It was in Dura that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down to the statue and were consequently thrown into a fiery furnace, from which they were miraculously delivered by God (Daniel 3:8-30).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>In the Bible, the East is a direction that is often associated with invading armies and nomadic tribes. In the book of Judges, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples are described as invading Israel, coming from the East with their livestock and tents (Judges 6:3, 33; 7:12; 8:10). These invasions were a recurring problem for the Israelites during the time of the judges. In the book of Ezekiel, the East is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against the Ammonites and Moabites, who were located east of Israel (Ezekiel 25:4, 10). The East was also the direction from which the Babylonians and Persians came to conquer and exile the people of Judah. In a broader sense, the East represented the vast desert regions and the nomadic tribes that inhabited them, often seen as a source of danger and instability for the settled populations of Israel and Judah.</ext_description>

Shemaiah was responsible for repairing the section of the wall adjacent to his house, which included the East Gate. The exact location and appearance of the East Gate are not described in detail, but it likely provided access to the eastern part of Jerusalem and the Kidron Valley. The East Gate may have been an important entry point for those coming from the Mount of Olives and the surrounding areas east of the city.

		<ext_description>Mount Ebal, also referred to as Mount Zalmon or Mount Ephraim, was a mountain located in the land of Canaan, north of Shechem. It stood opposite Mount Gerizim, forming the valley where the city of Shechem was situated. Mount Ebal held significant religious and historical importance for the Israelites. Prior to entering the Promised Land, Moses instructed the Israelites to conduct a ceremony on Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, pronouncing curses from Mount Ebal and blessings from Mount Gerizim (Deuteronomy 11:29; 27:4, 13). After the conquest of Canaan, Joshua led the Israelites in fulfilling this command, building an altar on Mount Ebal and conducting the ceremony as prescribed (Joshua 8:30, 33). In the time of Abimelech, Mount Zalmon (another name for Mount Ebal) was the site where he and his men cut down branches to set fire to the tower of Shechem (Judges 9:48). The mountain is also mentioned in poetic and prophetic texts, such as Psalm 68:14 and Jeremiah 4:15, which refer to Mount Zalmon and Mount Ephraim respectively, likely alluding to the same location as Mount Ebal.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ebenezer, meaning &quot;stone of help,&quot; was a memorial stone set up by the prophet Samuel to commemorate a significant victory of the Israelites over the Philistines. The stone was erected between Mizpah and Shen, in the territory of Israel. Prior to this victory, the Israelites had suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Philistines, who captured the Ark of the Covenant (1 Samuel 4:1; 5:1). The Ark was eventually returned, and Samuel led the Israelites in a ceremony of repentance at Mizpah. When the Philistines attacked again, God intervened on behalf of Israel, causing confusion among the Philistines and leading to their defeat (1 Samuel 7:7-11). To commemorate this divine intervention and victory, Samuel set up the stone and named it Ebenezer, acknowledging God's help and deliverance (1 Samuel 7:12). The stone served as a reminder to the Israelites of God's faithfulness and power in their battles against their enemies.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ecbatana was a city in Media where a scroll was found containing a decree by King Cyrus (Ezra 6:2).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ecbatana, also known as Achmetha, was an ancient city located in Media, a region in present-day Iran. It served as the capital of the Median Empire and later as a summer residence for Persian kings. In the biblical context, Ecbatana is mentioned in the book of Ezra as the place where a significant scroll was discovered during the reign of King Darius I of Persia (Ezra 6:2). The scroll contained a decree issued by King Cyrus, allowing the Jews to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and authorizing the use of royal funds to support the project. This discovery provided crucial evidence and support for the Jews in their efforts to restore the Temple and re-establish their religious practices in Jerusalem. Ecbatana's mention in the Bible highlights the city's importance as an administrative center and repository of official documents during the Persian period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Eden, a city or region mentioned in the Old Testament, possibly located in Mesopotamia or Syria (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12; Ezekiel 27:23).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Eden, also spelled as Edem in the Septuagint (LXX), was a city or region mentioned in the Old Testament. It is referred to as a place conquered by the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12) and as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23). The exact location of Eden is uncertain, but it was likely situated in Mesopotamia or Syria, given its association with the Assyrians and its trade relations with Tyre. It should not be confused with the Garden of Eden, as they are separate places. The biblical references to Eden provide little information about its history or significance, but its mention in the context of Assyrian conquests and Tyrian trade suggests that it was a place of some importance in the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Eden, the perfect garden created by God, where He placed Adam and Eve (Genesis 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16; Isaiah 51:3; Ezekiel 28:13; 31:9, 16, 18; 36:35; Joel 2:3).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Eden, also known as the Garden of Eden, was the perfect paradise created by God as a dwelling place for the first man and woman, Adam and Eve. It was planted by God in the east (Genesis 2:8) and was watered by a river that divided into four headwaters (Genesis 2:10). God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it (Genesis 2:15). The garden contained various trees, including the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:9). After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:23-24). Cherubim and a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden to guard the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24). The Garden of Eden is mentioned in later biblical passages as a symbol of perfect beauty, abundance, and God's ideal for His creation (Isaiah 51:3; Ezekiel 28:13; 31:9, 16, 18; 36:35; Joel 2:3). The exact location of the Garden of Eden is unknown, but it is believed to have been situated in the ancient Near East, possibly in Mesopotamia.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Eder was a town situated in the Negev, the southern region of the territory allocated to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns and villages belonging to Judah (Joshua 15:21). The exact location of Eder is unknown, but it was likely located in the arid wilderness south of Hebron. As one of the towns in the Negev, Eder would have faced the challenges of limited water resources and harsh desert conditions. </ext_description>

		<short_description>Edom, a nation descended from Esau that was often in conflict with Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Edom was a nation located southeast of Israel, in the area that is now southern Jordan. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, the twin brother of Jacob (Israel). The name Edom means &quot;red&quot;, referring to Esau being born red and selling his birthright for red stew. ¶Edom and Israel had a tumultuous relationship throughout their history. During the Exodus, Edom refused to let the Israelites pass through their territory. Edom was later defeated by King Saul and subjugated under King David. However, they rebelled in later years and were able to establish their independence from Judah. ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos and Obadiah all prophesied against Edom for its arrogance and for standing by when Judah was invaded by Babylon. Edom helped the Babylonians loot Jerusalem and expressed joy over its destruction. As a result, the prophets declared that Edom would face God's wrath and be completely destroyed.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Egypt, a powerful nation where the Israelites were enslaved until God delivered them in the Exodus.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Egypt was a prominent ancient civilization in northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River. In the Bible, Egypt is first mentioned as the place Abraham journeyed during a famine in Canaan (Genesis 12:10). Later, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt but rose to power as a trusted official of Pharaoh. During a famine, Jacob and his family settled in Egypt with Joseph. ¶After generations passed, the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptians (Exodus 1:8-14). God called Moses to deliver His people from bondage. After Pharaoh refused to free the Israelites, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt (Exodus 7-12). Finally, Pharaoh relented and the Israelites left in the Exodus. At the Red Sea, God miraculously allowed the Israelites to cross on dry ground but destroyed the pursuing Egyptian army (Exodus 14). ¶Egypt is often used in the Bible as a symbol of bondage and oppression. The prophets warned against trusting in Egypt's power instead of God (Isaiah 30:1-3, 31:1). Yet Egypt was also a place of refuge, as when Mary, Joseph and Jesus fled there to escape Herod (Matthew 2:13-15).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Egypt Sea, probably referring to the Gulf of Suez, an arm of the Red Sea.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Egypt Sea is mentioned in Isaiah 11:15 as a place that will be dried up when the Lord comes to deliver His people. Based on the context, this is likely referring to the Gulf of Suez, the western arm of the Red Sea that borders Egypt. ¶The Red Sea was the site of the miraculous crossing of the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 14). Isaiah's prophecy uses imagery reminiscent of that event to depict a future deliverance and restoration of God's people from the nations where they have been exiled. Just as God opened a path through the sea to redeem Israel from Egypt, so will He bring them back from the lands of their captivity.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ekron, one of the five principal Philistine cities, located in southwestern Canaan.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ekron was one of the five major cities of the Philistines, along with Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Gaza. It was located in the western part of Canaan, near the Mediterranean coast. The city was originally assigned to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:11,45-46) and then to Dan (Joshua 19:43), but the Israelites failed to conquer it (Judges 1:18-19). ¶During the time of Samuel, the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant and moved it to Ashdod, then Gath, and finally Ekron (1 Samuel 5:10). However, God afflicted the Ekronites with tumors, so they sent the Ark back to Israel (1 Samuel 6). Later, David killed Goliath, and the Israelites pursued the Philistines as far as Ekron (1 Samuel 17:52). ¶The prophets Amos (1:8), Zephaniah (2:4), and Zechariah (9:5,7) all foretold Ekron's destruction as part of God's judgment on the Philistines. King Ahaziah of Israel sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, regarding his illness, showing the city's religious influence (2 Kings 1:2-3,16).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Elah Valley, where David defeated the Philistine giant Goliath.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Elah Valley was the location of the memorable confrontation between David and the Philistine champion Goliath (1 Samuel 17). The Philistines gathered their armies there to battle against King Saul and the Israelites. ¶The valley was situated on the border between Judah and Philistia, near the city of Azekah. It was likely an open area suitable for battle. David, then a young shepherd boy, arrived at the Israelite camp and accepted Goliath's challenge. With a sling and a stone, David struck down Goliath, and the Philistines fled in defeat. ¶After this victory, the Elah Valley became famous as the site of David's triumph and the place where he launched his ascent to the throne. The &quot;sword of Goliath&quot; that David took from the fallen giant was kept in Nob, and David later retrieved it when fleeing from Saul (1 Samuel 21:9).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Elam, an ancient nation east of Babylon, at times an ally and at times an enemy of Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Elam was an ancient kingdom located east of Babylonia in what is now southwestern Iran. The Elamites were descendants of Shem, son of Noah (Genesis 10:22). Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, was an ally of other Mesopotamian kings who fought against Sodom and Gomorrah and took Lot captive before being defeated by Abraham (Genesis 14:1-16). ¶The Elamites were skilled archers (Isaiah 22:6) and were sometimes allies of Israel's enemies. Elamite kings are mentioned in Assyrian records of campaigns against Judah. The prophets Isaiah (11:11, 21:2, 22:6) and Jeremiah (25:25, 49:34-39) foretold Elam's conquest by the Babylonians and Medes as part of God's judgment. ¶However, Jeremiah also prophesied Elam's restoration in the latter days (49:39). Some Elamites were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9). Nehemiah's opponents included a man named Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab (Nehemiah 2:19, 6:1), possibly indicating alliances between Elam and Israel's neighbors. The references to Elam in Daniel 8:2 suggest the province maintained some importance during the Persian period.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Elath, also spelled Eloth, was a seaport located at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, an arm of the Red Sea. It was originally part of the territory of Edom (Deuteronomy 2:8) but came under Israelite control during the reign of Solomon. Solomon used Elath as a port for his fleet of ships that sailed to Ophir for gold (1 Kings 9:26, 2 Chronicles 8:17). ¶After the division of the kingdom, Elath remained under Judean control. King Uzziah of Judah rebuilt and fortified Elath, restoring it to Judah (2 Kings 14:22, 2 Chronicles 26:2). However, during the reign of Ahaz, the Edomites regained control of Elath and drove out the Judeans (2 Kings 16:6). The city later fell under Assyrian and Babylonian control. Today, Elath is identified with the modern Israeli city of Eilat.</ext_description>

Elealeh was one of the cities rebuilt and settled by the Reubenites (Numbers 32:3,37). ¶However, the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah later pronounced judgment on Moab, including Elealeh. Isaiah mentioned the city in his oracle against Moab (Isaiah 15:4, 16:9), foretelling that the &quot;weeping of Jazer extends to Elealeh.&quot; Jeremiah also predicted that the &quot;lament of Heshbon and Elealeh&quot; would be heard as far as Jahaz (Jeremiah 48:34). These prophecies indicate that Elealeh would face destruction along with the rest of Moab for their pride and idolatry.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Elim was a place in the Sinai wilderness where the Israelites camped during their journey from Egypt to Mount Sinai. It was the second encampment after crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 15:27). Elim is described as having twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, providing a refreshing oasis for the weary travelers. ¶The Israelites arrived at Elim after traveling three days in the wilderness without finding water (Exodus 15:22-26). At Marah, they complained about the bitter water, but God instructed Moses to throw a piece of wood into the water, making it sweet. Elim's abundant water and shade would have been a welcome relief after this trial. ¶Elim is also mentioned in the list of Israel's journey stages in Numbers 33:9-10. They camped there before setting out into the Wilderness of Sin, where God provided manna and quail for their hunger. The location of Elim is uncertain but is thought to be in the southwestern part of the Sinai Peninsula.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Elkosh is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Nahum 1:1, as the hometown of the prophet Nahum. No other details about the town are provided in the biblical text. Nahum's prophecy is primarily an oracle against the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, foretelling its destruction due to its wickedness and cruelty. ¶The exact location of Elkosh is unknown. Some scholars propose that it may have been in the region of Galilee, while others suggest it was in the southern kingdom of Judah. Another theory is that Elkosh was actually in Assyria, and that Nahum lived among the exiles there. However, the content of Nahum's prophecy, with its focus on Judah's deliverance from Assyrian oppression, makes a Judean location more likely. ¶Regardless of its exact location, Elkosh was significant as the birthplace of one of God's prophets who declared His judgment against a powerful enemy nation and His mercy toward His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ellasar, a Mesopotamian city-state whose king Arioch joined Chedorlaomer of Elam in battle against Sodom and Gomorrah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ellasar is mentioned in Genesis 14 as one of the kingdoms that joined the coalition led by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a battle against the cities of the plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah. The king of Ellasar was named Arioch (Genesis 14:1,9). ¶In the biblical account, the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (Zoar) had served Chedorlaomer for twelve years but rebelled in the thirteenth year. In response, Chedorlaomer and his allies, including Arioch of Ellasar, went to war against them in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea/Dead Sea region). The cities of the plain were defeated, and Sodom and Gomorrah were plundered. Lot, Abraham's nephew living in Sodom, was taken captive. ¶When Abraham heard of Lot's capture, he pursued Chedorlaomer's forces with his 318 trained men and defeated them near Damascus, rescuing Lot and recovering the goods and people taken from Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 14:13-16). ¶The exact location of Ellasar is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Mesopotamia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Larsa in southern Babylonia. Its mention in Genesis 14 reveals the geopolitical context of Abraham's time, with rivalries and alliances among the city-states and kingdoms of the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Elon is mentioned in Joshua 19:43 as one of the cities allotted to the tribe of Dan when the Promised Land was divided among the tribes of Israel. It is listed along with other cities in the western foothills and coastal plain, such as Aijalon, Timnah, and Ekron. ¶No further details about Elon are provided in the Bible. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. The city's name is derived from the Hebrew word for &quot;oak&quot; or &quot;terebinth,&quot; suggesting it may have been known for its large trees.</ext_description>

The Horites were a people who inhabited the hill country of Seir, later known as Edom. ¶The name El-paran means &quot;oak of Paran&quot; or &quot;terebinth of Paran,&quot; suggesting it was a significant tree or grove located in the wilderness of Paran. This wilderness area is believed to be located in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula, east of the Wilderness of Shur. ¶El-paran is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the battle between Chedorlaomer's forces and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah. After defeating the Horites in El-paran, Chedorlaomer's army turned back and advanced toward the cities of the plain, where they engaged in battle with the local kings.</ext_description>

On the day of His resurrection, two of Jesus' disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, discussing the recent events surrounding Jesus' death and the empty tomb. As they walked, Jesus Himself joined them, but they did not recognize Him. Jesus explained to them the prophecies concerning the Messiah in the Scriptures. When they reached Emmaus, the disciples urged Jesus to stay with them, and as He broke bread with them, their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him (Luk. 24:13-35). The exact location of Emmaus is uncertain, as there are several possible sites that have been proposed based on ancient traditions and archaeological evidence.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Enaim is mentioned in the Bible as the place where Tamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah, posed as a prostitute (Gen. 38:14,21). After the death of her husband, Tamar was denied the opportunity to marry Judah's youngest son, Shelah, as was customary. Determined to secure her rights and conceive a child, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and sat at the entrance to Enaim. Judah, not recognizing her, slept with her, and she conceived twin sons, Perez and Zerah (Gen. 38:27-30). When Judah later sought to find the supposed prostitute, he was told that there was no cult prostitute in Enaim (Gen. 38:21-22). The events at Enaim highlight the complex social and moral dynamics of the patriarchal period and the importance of securing one's lineage and rights within the family structure.</ext_description>

However, the Manassites failed to drive out the Canaanites from En-dor, so they continued to live among the Israelites. ¶The city is most notable as the place where King Saul sought the counsel of a medium on the eve of his final battle against the Philistines (1 Samuel 28:7). Desperate for guidance, Saul disguised himself and visited the medium, requesting her to conjure up the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel. The medium succeeded, and Samuel's spirit informed Saul that he and his sons would die in battle the next day. ¶Psalm 83:10 mentions En-dor in the context of a prayer for God's judgment against Israel's enemies, referring to the defeat of Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River near En-dor (Judges 4-5). The city's exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Jezreel Valley, north of Mount Gilboa.</ext_description>

In this vision, Ezekiel sees a river flowing from the temple, bringing life and healing to the land. He describes a future time when fishermen will stand along the shore of the Dead Sea, from En-gedi to Eneglaim, and spread their nets to catch an abundance of fish. ¶The name Eneglaim likely means &quot;spring of the two calves&quot; or &quot;fountain of the two heifers.&quot; Its exact location is unknown, but based on the context, it was probably situated near the Dead Sea, possibly at its northern end, opposite En-gedi. The mention of Eneglaim alongside En-gedi suggests it may have been a significant landmark or settlement. ¶Ezekiel's vision portrays a future restoration of Israel, with the land flourishing and providing sustenance for its people. The reference to Eneglaim, though brief, contributes to this picture of abundance and renewal.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Engedi (or Hazazon-tamar), an oasis in Judah where David sought refuge from Saul, also the site of Chedorlaomer's victory.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Engedi, also known as Hazazon-tamar, is an oasis located on the western shore of the Dead Sea, in the wilderness of Judah. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of its strategic location and its lush vegetation. ¶During the time of Abraham, Engedi (then called Hazazon-tamar) was one of the places where Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and his allies defeated the Amorites before attacking Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 14:7; 2 Chronicles 20:2). ¶Later, when David was fleeing from King Saul, he sought refuge in the strongholds of Engedi (1 Samuel 23:29). It was in the wilderness of Engedi that David had the opportunity to kill Saul but chose to spare his life, cutting off a corner of Saul's robe instead (1 Samuel 24:1-7). ¶The Song of Solomon mentions Engedi as a source of fragrant henna blossoms (Song of Solomon 1:14), testifying to its fertility and beauty. In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel, Engedi is mentioned as a place where fishermen will spread their nets, symbolizing abundance and prosperity (Ezekiel 47:10). ¶The name Engedi means &quot;spring of the kid (young goat)&quot; or &quot;fountain of the goat,&quot; likely referring to the freshwater springs that make the area an oasis in the desert. Today, Engedi is a nature reserve in Israel, known for its hiking trails, waterfalls, and diverse flora and fauna.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>En-hakkore, meaning &quot;spring of the caller,&quot; is the name given to a spring that miraculously appeared to quench Samson's thirst after his victory over the Philistines at Lehi (Judges 15:19). ¶After Samson had killed a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey, he became extremely thirsty and called out to the Lord for help. In response, God split open a hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. Samson drank from this spring, and his strength was restored. He named the spring En-hakkore, acknowledging that it was God who had answered his call for help. ¶The exact location of En-hakkore is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely in the vicinity of Lehi, which is believed to be in the Judean foothills, near the border between Judah and Philistia. The appearance of this spring was a miraculous provision from God, demonstrating His care for Samson and His power to sustain His chosen people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>En-rogel, a spring near Jerusalem, was the site of Adonijah's attempt to become king and later served as a meeting place for David's supporters.</short_description>
		<ext_description>En-rogel, also known as the Stone of Zoheleth, was a spring located near Jerusalem, on the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin (Joshua 15:7; 18:16). It played a significant role in two events related to the succession of King David's throne. ¶First, Adonijah, one of David's sons, attempted to establish himself as king at En-rogel without David's knowledge or consent (1 Kings 1:9). Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Stone of Zoheleth, which was near En-rogel, and invited his brothers and the king's officials to support his claim to the throne. However, his attempt was thwarted when the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba informed David of the situation, leading to Solomon being anointed as king (1 Kings 1:11-40). ¶Later, during Absalom's rebellion against David, En-rogel served as a meeting place for David's supporters, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (2 Samuel 17:17). They would bring information from the city to David, who had fled from Jerusalem. A servant girl would go and tell them the information, and they would then go and tell King David, to avoid being seen entering the city. ¶The name En-rogel means &quot;spring of the fuller&quot; or &quot;fountain of the treader,&quot; possibly referring to the presence of a water source used for washing or treading clothes. Its exact location is debated, but it is believed to be either the modern-day Bir Ayub (Job's Well) or the Virgin's Spring (Gihon Spring) in the Kidron Valley, south of the City of David.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>En-shemesh, meaning &quot;spring of the sun,&quot; was a spring located on the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin, near Jerusalem (Joshua 15:7; 18:17). It is mentioned twice in the Bible, both times in the context of describing the boundary lines of these two tribes. ¶In Joshua 15:7, En-shemesh is listed as one of the landmarks on the northern border of Judah, along with the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben, and the valley of Achor. In Joshua 18:17, it is mentioned again as part of the southern border of Benjamin, along with Geliloth and the stone of Bohan. ¶The exact location of En-shemesh is uncertain, but it was likely situated east of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of the Kidron Valley. Its name, &quot;spring of the sun,&quot; may suggest that it was located in a sunny spot or that it had some association with sun worship in Canaanite times. ¶Apart from its role in demarcating the tribal boundaries, no other details about En-shemesh are provided in the Bible. Its mention in the boundary descriptions helps to establish the geographical extent of Judah and Benjamin's territories during the division of the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ephah is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Isaiah 60:6, as part of a prophecy describing the future glory of Jerusalem. In this passage, Isaiah speaks of various nations and tribes coming to Jerusalem, bringing their wealth and resources as offerings to the Lord. ¶Among these tribes is Ephah, which is described as bringing a multitude of camels and dromedaries (young camels) from Midian and Sheba. This suggests that Ephah was an Arabian tribe known for their camel herds and their involvement in the caravan trade. ¶The name Ephah is associated with the Midianites, as one of Abraham's sons by his concubine Keturah was named Ephah (Genesis 25:4). However, it is unclear whether the Ephah mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy is directly related to this individual or simply shares the same name. ¶Isaiah's prophecy portrays a future time when the wealth of the nations, including that of the Arabian tribes like Ephah, will be brought to Jerusalem in recognition of the Lord's glory and the significance of His people. The inclusion of Ephah in this prophecy highlights the far-reaching influence and attraction of the restored Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ephes-dammim, also known as Pas-dammim, was a place located between Socoh and Azekah in Judah where the Philistines and the Israelites faced each other in battle (1 Samuel 17:1; 1 Chronicles 11:13). It was the site of the famous confrontation between David and the Philistine giant Goliath. ¶The Philistines had gathered their forces at Ephes-dammim, while Saul and the men of Israel were encamped in the Valley of Elah. Goliath, a champion from Gath, emerged from the Philistine camp and challenged the Israelites to send out a warrior to face him in single combat (1 Samuel 17:4-10). ¶David, who had come to the Israelite camp to bring supplies to his brothers, accepted Goliath's challenge. With a sling and a stone, David defeated Goliath, leading to a great victory for the Israelites over the Philistines (1 Samuel 17:48-53). ¶The alternate name Pas-dammim, used in 1 Chronicles 11:13, may be a variant spelling or a scribal error. The exact location of Ephes-dammim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains, where many battles between the Israelites and Philistines took place.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor, was an important center for early Christianity and the recipient of one of Paul's epistles.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ephesus was an ancient Greek city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It was one of the largest and most important cities in the Roman province of Asia and played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity. ¶The apostle Paul visited Ephesus during his second and third missionary journeys (Acts 18:19-21; 19:1-41). During his third journey, Paul stayed in Ephesus for over two years, preaching the gospel and establishing a strong Christian community (Acts 19:8-10). Many Ephesians turned from their pagan practices and embraced the faith, which led to a decline in the sale of silver shrines of the goddess Artemis (Diana), causing a riot instigated by the silversmiths (Acts 19:23-41). ¶Paul later wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians, one of his prison epistles, to strengthen and encourage the believers in Ephesus (Ephesians 1:1). In this letter, Paul expounds on the nature of the church, the unity of believers in Christ, and the importance of living a life worthy of the calling they had received. ¶Ephesus was also one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 1:11; 2:1-7). In the message to the church in Ephesus, the risen Christ commends their hard work and perseverance but admonishes them for having forsaken their first love and calls them to repent and return to their former devotion. ¶The city was famous for its Temple of Artemis (Diana), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (Acts 19:35). It was also an important center of learning, with a renowned library. Today, the ruins of Ephesus, including the remains of the theater where the riot took place (Acts 19:29), are a popular tourist attraction and a testament to the city's rich history and its role in the early Christian church.</ext_description>

By withdrawing to this area, Jesus sought to avoid confrontation with His enemies until the appointed time for His passion and death. ¶The exact location of Ephraim is uncertain, but it may be the same as the city of Ephron mentioned in 2 Chronicles 13:19, which was situated in the hill country of Judah, near Bethel.

		<short_description>The Ephraim Gate, a gate in Jerusalem's wall that was broken down by King Jehoash of Israel during his conflict with King Amaziah of Judah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Ephraim Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of the Divided Kingdom. It is mentioned in the context of the conflict between King Jehoash of Israel and King Amaziah of Judah (2 Kings 14:13; 2 Chronicles 25:23). ¶After Amaziah's defeat by Jehoash, the king of Israel came to Jerusalem and broke down a section of the city wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of about 400 cubits (approximately 600 feet or 180 meters). This action was likely meant to humiliate Judah and demonstrate Israel's military superiority. ¶The Ephraim Gate was probably located on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may have been situated near the modern-day Damascus Gate or Herod's Gate. The destruction of this portion of the wall would have left Jerusalem vulnerable and symbolized the weakened state of Judah under Amaziah's rule.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Ephraim Gate, a gate in Jerusalem's wall that was rebuilt during Nehemiah's time and used for public gatherings and proce∟ssions.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Ephraim Gate is mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah as one of the gates in Jerusalem's wall that was rebuilt and dedicated during Nehemiah's governorship (Nehemiah 8:16; 12:39). After the Babylonian exile, Nehemiah led the effort to reconstruct the city walls and gates, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. ¶In Nehemiah 8:16, the Ephraim Gate is mentioned as one of the locations where the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Book of the Law during the Feast of Tabernacles. The public reading of the Law was an important event in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community after their return from exile. ¶Nehemiah 12:39 describes a dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall, during which two processions of singers and musicians marched along the top of the wall in opposite directions, meeting at the Ephraim Gate before proceeding to the Temple. ¶The Ephraim Gate's location is not specified, but it was likely on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim. Its inclusion in these events highlights its significance as a public gathering place and a symbol of Jerusalem's restoration and spiritual renewal under Nehemiah's leadership.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Ephron is mentioned in Joshua 15:9 and 18:15 as a landmark on the border between the territories allotted to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is described as being located near the city of Kiriath-jearim, also known as Baalah or Kiriath-baal. ¶The border description in Joshua 15:9 traces the boundary of Judah, stating that it went from the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hinnom to the northern slope of Mount Ephron. Similarly, Joshua 18:15 describes the southern border of Benjamin, which ran from Kiriath-jearim to Mount Ephron and then turned northward. ¶The exact location of Mount Ephron is uncertain, but based on the biblical description, it was likely situated in the hill country west of Jerusalem, near the modern-day city of Abu Ghosh or Qaryat el-Inab. The mountain's name, Ephron, may be derived from a Canaanite personal name or could be related to the Hebrew word &quot;epher,&quot; meaning &quot;gazelle.&quot; ¶The mention of Mount Ephron in the border descriptions helps to delineate the territories of Judah and Benjamin and provides insight into the geographical landscape of the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Erech, an ancient Mesopotamian city that was part of Nimrod's kingdom and later inhabited by people who opposed the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Erech, also known as Uruk or Warka, was an ancient Mesopotamian city located in the southern part of modern-day Iraq. It is mentioned twice in the Bible, in Genesis 10:10 and Ezra 4:9. ¶In Genesis 10:10, Erech is listed as one of the cities that formed the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom in the land of Shinar (Babylonia). Nimrod, a mighty hunter and ruler, is described as establishing a powerful kingdom that included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. ¶Ezra 4:9 mentions the people of Erech among those who wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and the city walls after the Babylonian exile. This suggests that inhabitants of Erech were among those deported and resettled in other parts of the Persian Empire, and they sought to hinder the Jewish returnees' efforts to reestablish their homeland. ¶Archaeologically, Erech is one of the oldest cities in Mesopotamia, with evidence of continuous habitation from the 5th millennium BC. It was an important center of Sumerian culture and religion, known for its impressive ziggurats and the Gilgamesh Epic, one of the earliest known works of literature. ¶The biblical mentions of Erech, though brief, attest to its significance as an ancient Mesopotamian city and its interaction with the history and people of Israel, both in the early stages of civilization and during the post-exilic period.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Esau is a term used in the Book of Obadiah to refer to the mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. The Edomites lived in the area south of the Dead Sea, extending from the Wadi Zered to the Gulf of Aqaba, in what is now southern Jordan and Israel. ¶In his prophecy, Obadiah declares God's judgment against Edom for their hostile actions and attitudes toward Israel, particularly during the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem (Obadiah 1:8, 9, 19, 21). The Edomites had rejoiced over Judah's destruction and had even participated in looting the city and capturing fleeing Israelites (Obadiah 1:11-14). ¶Obadiah prophesies that God will bring down the &quot;wise men&quot; and &quot;mighty men&quot; of Edom, and that their mountain stronghold will be unable to protect them from divine judgment (Obadiah 1:8-9). He also foretells that the house of Jacob and Joseph will possess the territories of Edom and the surrounding nations, and that deliverers will come from Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau (Obadiah 1:19, 21). ¶The reference to Mount Esau symbolizes the pride and security of the Edomites in their mountainous territory, as well as their opposition to God's people.

The well was located in the Gerar Valley, where Isaac had settled after the Philistines had stopped up the wells previously dug by his father. ¶When Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water, the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with them, claiming the water as their own. As a result, Isaac named the well Esek, which means &quot;contention&quot; or &quot;dispute,&quot; reflecting the conflict that had arisen over the water rights. ¶The incident at Esek demonstrates the ongoing tensions between Isaac and the local inhabitants, as well as the importance of water sources in the semi-arid region. It also highlights Isaac's peaceful nature, as he chose to move on and dig another well rather than engage in further confrontation with the herdsmen of Gerar.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Eshcol Valley is mentioned in the Book of Numbers as the location where the twelve Israelite spies, sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan, obtained a large cluster of grapes (Numbers 13:23-24). The valley was named after Eshcol, an Amorite who was an ally of Abraham (Genesis 14:13, 24). ¶During the reconnaissance mission, the spies came to the Eshcol Valley and cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two men. They also gathered pomegranates and figs from the area (Numbers 13:23). The bountiful produce of the valley was used as evidence of the land's fertility when the spies reported back to Moses and the Israelites (Numbers 13:27). ¶However, despite the Eshcol Valley's fruitfulness, the spies' report also emphasized the strength of the Canaanite inhabitants and their fortified cities, which led to fear and rebellion among the Israelites (Numbers 13:28-33; 14:1-4). As a result, God condemned the unbelieving generation to wander in the wilderness for forty years (Numbers 14:26-35). ¶The Eshcol Valley is also mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:24, recounting the spies' journey, and in Numbers 32:9, where it is referred to as a symbol of the Promised Land's abundance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, near Hebron.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Eshtaol was a city located in the Shephelah, or foothills, of Judah. It was initially allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:33) but was later assigned to the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:41). ¶Eshtaol is particularly associated with the story of Samson, the legendary Israelite judge. Samson was born in the nearby town of Zorah and is described as moving between Zorah and Eshtaol, where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him (Judges 13:25). After Samson's death, he was buried between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father, Manoah (Judges 16:31). ¶Eshtaol also played a role in the Danite migration narrative. Due to limited territory and pressure from the Philistines, a group of Danites sent spies from Zorah and Eshtaol to search for a new land to settle (Judges 18:2). After the spies returned with a favorable report, six hundred men from the clan of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol to conquer the city of Laish in the north (Judges 18:8, 11). ¶The descendants of the Eshtaolites, a clan from Eshtaol, are mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:53 among the descendants of Judah's son Shobal. This suggests that the city maintained its ties to the tribe of Judah even after being allotted to Dan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Eshtemoa, also known as Eshtemoh, was a city located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:50). It was allotted to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, as one of their cities (Joshua 21:14; 1 Chronicles 6:57). ¶Several individuals are associated with Eshtemoa in the genealogies of Judah. In 1 Chronicles 4:17, Ishbah is mentioned as the father of Eshtemoa. Later, in 1 Chronicles 4:19, the sons of Ezrah are listed, including Eshtemoa. ¶During the time of David, when he was hiding from King Saul in the wilderness of Judah, David sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to the elders of Eshtemoa, among other cities (1 Samuel 30:28). This act of sharing the spoils was likely a gesture of goodwill and a way to strengthen alliances with the cities that had supported him. ¶The exact location of Eshtemoa is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the modern-day village of es-Semu'a, about 15 kilometers south of Hebron. As a Levitical city, Eshtemoa would have played a role in the religious life of the surrounding region, with the Levites serving as teachers, judges, and spiritual leaders.</ext_description>

These villages were part of Simeon's inheritance within the territory of Judah (Joshua 19:1-9). ¶The exact location of Etam in both contexts is uncertain, and it is possible that there were two different places named Etam.

		<short_description>Etam, a city in Judah fortified by King Rehoboam after the division of the kingdom.</short_description>
		<ext_description>In 2 Chronicles 11:6, Etam is mentioned as one of the cities that King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fortified in Judah after the kingdom was divided. Rehoboam's kingdom consisted of the southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin, while the northern tribes followed Jeroboam I. ¶As part of his efforts to strengthen his reign and defend his territory, Rehoboam built up the defenses of several key cities, including Etam. The fortification of Etam suggests that it was a strategically important location, possibly guarding a trade route or protecting the southern border of Judah. ¶The exact location of this Etam is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Judah, possibly near Bethlehem. Some scholars propose that it may be the same as the Etam mentioned in Judges 15, where Samson hid from the Philistines, but this is not conclusively established.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Etam, the cliff where Samson hid after defeating the Philistines, located in Judah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Etam is mentioned in the Book of Judges as the place where Samson went and stayed after he had struck down many Philistines in revenge for his wife being given to another man (Judges 15:8). The text describes Etam as a cleft or split in the rock, suggesting that it was a natural stronghold or hiding place. ¶After Samson's attack on the Philistines, they came up to Judah and demanded that the men of Judah deliver Samson to them. Three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and asked Samson to surrender, fearing Philistine retaliation (Judges 15:11). Samson agreed to be bound and handed over to the Philistines, but he broke free from his bonds and struck down a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey (Judges 15:14-15). ¶The exact location of the rock of Etam is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Judah, possibly near the border with Philistia. The area was known for its rugged terrain and numerous caves, which would have provided natural shelter and defense.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Etham, a wilderness area on the edge of the desert where the Israelites camped during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Etham is mentioned in the Book of Exodus and Numbers as one of the places where the Israelites camped during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. After leaving Succoth, the Israelites camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness (Exodus 13:20; Numbers 33:6). ¶The location of Etham is described as being on the edge of the wilderness, likely referring to the Sinai desert. It was the last stop before the Israelites turned back and camped near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea (Numbers 33:7). ¶The name Etham may be derived from the Egyptian word &quot;khetam,&quot; meaning &quot;fortress&quot; or &quot;castle,&quot; suggesting that it was a border fortification marking the edge of Egyptian territory. Some scholars propose that Etham was located near the present-day Ismailia, on the eastern edge of the Nile delta, but the exact location remains uncertain. ¶The wilderness of Etham is also mentioned in Numbers 33:8, referring to the area through which the Israelites passed after crossing the Red Sea. This suggests that the name Etham was associated with a larger region, extending from the edge of the Nile delta to the Sinai desert.</ext_description>

The Shephelah was known for its fertile soil and served as a buffer zone between the Israelites and the Philistines, who occupied the coastal plain. ¶The mention of Ether in the lists of cities allotted to Judah and Simeon helps to define the extent of their territories and provides insight into the geography of the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Euphrates, a major river in the ancient Near East, often served as a boundary marker for the Promised Land and was the site of significant events in biblical history.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Euphrates is one of the most significant rivers mentioned in the Bible, playing a crucial role in the geography, history, and prophecy of the ancient Near East. It is often referred to simply as &quot;the River&quot; or &quot;Shibolet&quot; (meaning &quot;ear of grain&quot;) in Hebrew. ¶In the Garden of Eden narrative, the Euphrates is one of the four rivers that flowed from the garden (Genesis 2:14). Later, it is mentioned as part of the boundary of the Promised Land, as God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates (Genesis 15:18; Deuteronomy 1:7; 11:24; Joshua 1:4). ¶The Euphrates served as a natural boundary between the Assyrian and Babylonian empires and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It was the site of several significant events, such as the battle of Carchemish, where the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians (Jeremiah 46:2), and the place where Jeremiah hid a linen belt as a symbol of God's judgment on Judah (Jeremiah 13:4-7). ¶In the book of Revelation, the Euphrates is mentioned in connection with the sixth trumpet judgment (Revelation 9:14) and the sixth bowl judgment (Revelation 16:12), where the river is dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east. ¶Throughout the Bible, the Euphrates is used as a symbol of the extent of God's promised blessings (Psalm 72:8), the reach of Israel's enemies (Isaiah 7:20; 8:7), and the future restoration of Israel (Isaiah 11:15; 27:12; Micah 7:12; Zechariah 9:10). ¶The Euphrates played a significant role in the history and commerce of the ancient Near East, with many important cities and civilizations situated along its banks, such as Babylon, Ur, and Carchemish. It was a vital source of water for irrigation and transportation, and its fertile floodplains supported agriculture and trade.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Stone of Ezel, a location where David and Jonathan planned to meet and communicate secretly during David's flight from King Saul.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Stone of Ezel is mentioned in 1 Samuel 20:19 as the place where David and Jonathan planned to meet and communicate secretly during David's flight from King Saul. The name &quot;Ezel&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word &quot;azel,&quot; meaning &quot;departure&quot; or &quot;going away,&quot; possibly referring to David's intended departure from Saul's court. ¶In the context of the narrative, David had become aware of Saul's intention to harm him and sought Jonathan's help to determine the king's true intentions. Jonathan devised a plan to shoot arrows near the Stone of Ezel as a signal to David. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were on the near side of the stone, it would indicate that David was safe to return. However, if Jonathan said that the arrows were beyond the stone, it would mean that David should flee for his life (1 Samuel 20:20-22). ¶The exact location of the Stone of Ezel is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in a field near Gibeah, Saul's hometown, where David and Jonathan could meet without arousing suspicion. The stone may have served as a boundary marker or a prominent landmark that could be easily identified. ¶The Stone of Ezel incident demonstrates the deep friendship between David and Jonathan and their loyalty to each other, even in the face of Saul's hostility. It also showcases their trust in God and their willingness to communicate and act in wisdom to protect David's life.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ezion-geber is mentioned in the Bible as both an encampment site during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings and a significant port city on the Red Sea during the reigns of Solomon and Jehoshaphat. ¶In the context of the Exodus, Ezion-geber is listed as one of the places where the Israelites camped after departing from Kadesh and before entering the land of Canaan (Numbers 33:35-36; Deuteronomy 2:8). It was located near Elath, at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the modern-day country of Jordan. ¶During Solomon's reign, Ezion-geber became a major port city and a center for maritime trade. Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which sailed to Ophir and brought back gold, silver, and other precious materials (1 Kings 9:26-28; 2 Chronicles 8:17-18). The strategic location of Ezion-geber allowed Solomon to establish trade routes with Arabia, East Africa, and possibly even India. ¶Later, during the reign of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, there was an attempt to revive the maritime trade from Ezion-geber.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Fair Havens, a harbor on the island of Crete where Paul's ship stopped during his journey to Rome.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Fair Havens is mentioned in Acts 27:8 as a harbor on the southern coast of the island of Crete, where the ship carrying the apostle Paul to Rome took shelter during difficult sailing conditions. The harbor's name, &quot;Fair Havens&quot; (Greek: Kaloi Limenes), suggests that it was a suitable place for ships to anchor and wait out unfavorable weather. ¶According to the narrative in Acts, Paul and his companions were sailing from Caesarea to Rome when they encountered strong winds that forced them to sail along the southern coast of Crete. After passing Cape Salmone, they arrived at Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea (Acts 27:8). ¶While at Fair Havens, Paul advised the crew to spend the winter there, as he foresaw that continuing the voyage would result in damage and loss (Acts 27:9-10). However, the centurion in charge of the ship decided to follow the advice of the pilot and the ship's owner, who wanted to reach Phoenix, another harbor on Crete, to spend the winter (Acts 27:11-12). ¶The exact location of Fair Havens is believed to be near the modern-day village of Kaloi Limenes, which bears the same name as the ancient harbor. Archaeological evidence, including anchors and other maritime artifacts, has been found in the area, supporting the identification of this site as the Fair Havens mentioned in the Bible.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Fish Gate, a gate in Jerusalem's wall, was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah during Nehemiah's time and was a location of judgment and trade.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Fish Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Old Testament in connection with the city's fortifications and rebuilding efforts. It is believed to have been located on the northern side of the city, possibly near the present-day Damascus Gate. ¶In Nehemiah 3:3, during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall after the Babylonian exile, the Fish Gate was repaired by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. The Fish Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:39, where it is listed among the gates that the procession of dedication passed through during the celebration of the completed wall. ¶The name &quot;Fish Gate&quot; suggests that it may have been a location where fish were sold or where fishermen entered the city to sell their catch. It is possible that the gate was named after the nearby fish market or the road leading to the Mediterranean Sea, where fish were brought into the city. ¶In Zephaniah 1:10, the Fish Gate is mentioned in a prophecy of judgment against Jerusalem, where the Lord declares that a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, along with wailing from the Second Quarter and a loud crash from the hills. This passage indicates that the Fish Gate was a significant location within the city and that its destruction would be a sign of God's judgment. ¶The rebuilding of the Fish Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of the sons of Hassenaah in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different families and groups.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Forest of Ephraim, where the battle between David's forces and Absalom's army took place during Absalom's rebellion.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Forest of Ephraim is mentioned in 2 Samuel 18:6 as the location of the battle between the forces loyal to King David and the army of his rebellious son Absalom. This battle took place during Absalom's rebellion against his father, which had forced David to flee from Jerusalem. ¶David's army, led by Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, met Absalom's forces in the Forest of Ephraim. The battle spread out over the countryside, and the forest claimed more lives than the sword (2 Samuel 18:8). David's men defeated Absalom's army, and Absalom himself was killed when his hair got caught in the branches of a tree, and Joab thrust three javelins into his heart (2 Samuel 18:9-15). ¶The exact location of the Forest of Ephraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been situated east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead, where the tribe of Ephraim had some land allotted to them (Joshua 17:15-18). Others suggest that it could have been a forested area within the territory of Ephraim, west of the Jordan. ¶The significance of the Forest of Ephraim lies in its role as the setting for the decisive battle that ended Absalom's rebellion and restored David to the throne. The dense forest terrain likely contributed to the high number of casualties and the difficulty in pursuing the retreating enemy forces.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Forum of Appius, also known as Appii Forum, is mentioned in Acts 28:15 as one of the places where Christians from Rome came to meet the apostle Paul as he was being brought to the city as a prisoner. The Forum of Appius was a market town located along the Appian Way, the main road connecting Rome to southern Italy. ¶According to the narrative in Acts, after Paul had appealed to Caesar and was sent to Rome, he was permitted to stay by himself with a soldier guarding him (Acts 28:16). As Paul approached the city, believers from Rome traveled to meet him at two locations: the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns (Acts 28:15). ¶The Forum of Appius was situated about 43 miles (69 kilometers) southeast of Rome and was a popular stopping point for travelers. It was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who initiated the construction of the Appian Way in 312 BC. The town likely served as a marketplace and resting place for those journeying along the road. ¶The fact that Christians from Rome came to meet Paul at the Forum of Appius demonstrates the strong support and eagerness of the Roman believers to welcome and encourage the apostle. This meeting would have provided Paul with much-needed fellowship and reassurance as he faced the challenges of his impending trial before Caesar. ¶The mention of the Forum of Appius in the biblical account of Paul's journey to Rome provides insight into the spread of Christianity and the connections between believers in different parts of the Roman Empire. It also highlights the importance of the Appian Way as a major transportation route and the role of market towns like the Forum of Appius in facilitating travel and communication in the ancient world.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Fountain Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah in connection with the city's rebuilding efforts after the Babylonian exile. It is believed to have been located on the southeastern side of the city, possibly near the Pool of Siloam or the King's Garden. ¶In Nehemiah 2:14, during Nehemiah's nighttime inspection of the city's walls, he passed by the Fountain Gate and noted its state of disrepair. Later, in Nehemiah 3:15, Shallun, the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, is recorded as having repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, covered it, and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. Additionally, he repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah (Siloam) by the King's Garden, as far as the stairs that went down from the City of David. ¶The Fountain Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:37, where it is described as a location along the route of the procession of dedication for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. The procession, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, started at the Fountain Gate and proceeded to the Water Gate, then to the Sheep Gate, and finally to the Temple. ¶The name &quot;Fountain Gate&quot; suggests that it may have been located near a water source, possibly the Gihon Spring or the Pool of Siloam, which were important for Jerusalem's water supply. Its proximity to the King's Garden also indicates that it was in an area of the city associated with royalty and agriculture. ¶The rebuilding of the Fountain Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of Shallun in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different individuals and groups.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gaash, a mountain in the region of Ephraim, was the burial place of Joshua and the homeland of two of David's mighty men.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gaash is mentioned in the Bible as a mountain or hill located in the tribal territory of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. It is most notably associated with Joshua, the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites during the conquest of the Promised Land. ¶According to Joshua 24:30 and Judges 2:9, after Joshua had led the Israelites into Canaan and divided the land among the tribes, he died at the age of 110 and was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. ¶The specific location of Mount Gaash is not clearly identified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated in the vicinity of Timnath-serah, which is thought to be modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, located approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Shechem. ¶In addition to being the burial place of Joshua, Mount Gaash is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men. In 2 Samuel 23:30 and 1 Chronicles 11:32, Hiddai (or Hurai) of the brooks of Gaash is listed among the elite warriors who fought alongside David. This suggests that the region around Mount Gaash was known for its brave and skilled fighters. ¶The mention of Mount Gaash in the Bible serves to underscore the importance of Joshua as a key figure in Israel's history and his significant role in leading the people into the Promised Land. The association of this location with Joshua's burial place and the homeland of some of David's mighty men highlights the enduring legacy of faith and courage that these individuals embodied.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gabbatha, also known as the Stone Pavement, was the location in Jerusalem where Pontius Pilate sat in judgment over Jesus.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gabbatha, also known as the Stone Pavement, is mentioned in John 19:13 as the location where Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, sat in judgment over Jesus during his trial. The Gospel of John provides this detail as part of the narrative of Jesus' passion and crucifixion. ¶According to John's account, after Pilate had questioned Jesus and found no guilt in him, he brought Jesus out to the Jews and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called &quot;The Stone Pavement,&quot; which in Aramaic is &quot;Gabbatha.&quot; This event took place around the sixth hour on the day of Preparation for the Passover. ¶The term &quot;Gabbatha&quot; is an Aramaic word that means &quot;elevated place&quot; or &quot;platform.&quot; The Stone Pavement, or Lithostrotos in Greek, refers to a raised, paved area, possibly adorned with mosaic or stone tiles. This platform was likely located in the open courtyard of Herod's palace in Jerusalem, where the Roman governor would conduct official business and pronounce judgments. ¶The mention of Gabbatha in the context of Jesus' trial highlights the political and judicial aspects of the proceedings. Pilate, as the Roman governor, represented the authority of the Roman Empire, and his seating on the judgment seat at Gabbatha underscores the official nature of the trial and the verdict he would render. ¶The specific location of Gabbatha within Jerusalem is not conclusively known, but it is believed to have been near the present-day Antonia Fortress, north of the Temple Mount. Archaeological excavations in the area have uncovered remains of a large, paved courtyard that may have been the Stone Pavement mentioned in the Gospel of John. ¶The reference to Gabbatha in the Bible provides a vivid detail of the setting of Jesus' trial and the events leading up to his crucifixion. It also offers insight into the political and judicial realities of the time, as well as the significance of the location where the momentous decision regarding Jesus' fate was made.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Galatia was a region located in central Asia Minor, in present-day Turkey. It was named after the Galatians, a Celtic people who settled in the area in the 3rd century BC. In the New Testament, Galatia is mentioned several times in connection with the Apostle Paul's missionary work and his epistle to the Galatians. Paul visited the region of Galatia on his first and second missionary journeys (Acts 16:6; 18:23), establishing churches and preaching the gospel. He later wrote a letter to the churches in Galatia, addressing issues of faith, justification, and Christian liberty (Galatians 1:2). In his epistle, Paul expressed concern about the Galatians being led astray by false teachings and emphasized the importance of salvation through faith in Christ alone (Galatians 3:1; 6:18). Galatia is also mentioned in other New Testament passages, such as 1 Corinthians 16:1, where Paul instructs the Galatian churches to participate in a collection for the believers in Jerusalem, and 2 Timothy 4:10, where it is noted that Crescens had gone to Galatia. Additionally, 1 Peter 1:1 includes Galatia among the regions where the apostle Peter addressed his letter to the scattered believers.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Galilee, a region in northern Israel, was a significant location in Jesus' life and ministry, as well as the homeland of many of his disciples.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Galilee is a region located in northern Israel, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to the east, and the Jezreel Valley to the south. In the Old Testament, Galilee is mentioned as part of the tribal allotments of Naphtali (Joshua 20:7) and Zebulun (Joshua 21:32), and as a region that Solomon gave to Hiram, king of Tyre (1 Kings 9:11). ¶In the New Testament, Galilee plays a significant role in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a town in Galilee (Luke 2:39), and began his public ministry in the region after being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9). Many of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were from Galilee (Acts 1:11). ¶Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is recorded as traveling and teaching extensively in Galilee, performing miracles and drawing large crowds (Matthew 4:23-25; Mark 1:28, 39; Luke 4:14, 44). Notable events in Galilee include the wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11), the healing of the centurion's servant (Luke 7:1-10), and the feeding of the five thousand (Luke 9:10-17). ¶Galilee was also the location of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to his disciples (Matthew 28:7, 10, 16; John 21:1-14). After Jesus' ascension, the early church spread throughout Galilee, Judea, and Samaria (Acts 9:31). ¶In addition to its religious significance, Galilee was known for its agricultural fertility and was an important center of trade and commerce. The region was inhabited by a mix of Jews and Gentiles, and was known for its distinct accent and dialect (Matthew 26:69; Mark 14:70; Luke 22:59). ¶The Bible also mentions several political and social events connected to Galilee, such as the census during the time of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:1-4), the rule of Herod Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee (Luke 3:1), and the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices (Luke 13:1-2).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gallim, a town in Benjamin, was the home of Paltiel, Michal's husband, and is mentioned in a prophecy of Isaiah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gallim is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the tribal territory of Benjamin. It is referenced in two separate contexts in the Old Testament. ¶In 1 Samuel 25:44, Gallim is identified as the hometown of Paltiel, the man to whom King Saul gave his daughter Michal in marriage after she had previously been married to David. This event occurred during the time when David was fleeing from Saul's pursuit and Saul had given Michal to Paltiel as a political move to strengthen his own position. ¶Later, in Isaiah 10:30, Gallim is mentioned in a prophetic passage describing the advance of the Assyrian army toward Jerusalem. In this context, the town is personified as a daughter who is called to cry out, along with other nearby towns, in the face of the impending invasion. ¶The exact location of Gallim is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly near the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. The name &quot;Gallim&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;springs&quot; or &quot;heaps,&quot; possibly indicating the presence of water sources or mounds in the area.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Gamad were a people group mentioned in Ezekiel's prophecy as defenders of the towers of Tyre.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Gamad are mentioned only once in the Bible, in Ezekiel 27:11, as part of a prophetic oracle concerning the city of Tyre. In this passage, Ezekiel describes the wealth, splendor, and trade relationships of Tyre, portraying it as a prosperous and well-defended city. ¶Among the various peoples and nations listed as contributing to Tyre's defense and commerce, the Gamad are specifically mentioned as being &quot;in your towers.&quot; This suggests that they served as guards or watchmen on the city's fortifications, helping to protect Tyre from potential threats. ¶The exact identity and origin of the Gamad are not provided in the biblical text, and there is limited historical or archaeological information about them outside of this single reference. Some scholars propose that they may have been a tribe or clan from the region around Tyre, possibly of Phoenician or Syrian origin, but this remains uncertain. ¶The mention of the Gamad in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to underscore the extensive network of alliances and trade relationships that Tyre had established, as well as the city's formidable defenses. However, despite the presence of the Gamad and other defenders, Ezekiel's prophecy ultimately foretells the downfall and destruction of Tyre at the hands of its enemies.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gareb, a hill mentioned in Jeremiah 31:39, was located near Jerusalem and was to be included within the city's future boundaries.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gareb is a hill mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Jeremiah. In a prophecy concerning the future restoration and expansion of Jerusalem, Jeremiah declares that the city will be rebuilt and that its boundaries will extend &quot;as far as the hill Gareb&quot; (Jeremiah 31:39). ¶The exact location of the hill of Gareb is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated near Jerusalem, possibly to the west or northwest of the city. The name &quot;Gareb&quot; is derived from a Hebrew word meaning &quot;scabby&quot; or &quot;leprous,&quot; which may suggest that the hill was associated with a place where people with skin diseases were quarantined. ¶Jeremiah's prophecy indicates that, in the future, Jerusalem will be rebuilt and its boundaries will be extended to include the hill of Gareb. This expansion of the city's limits symbolizes the growth and prosperity that will characterize Jerusalem during the time of its restoration. ¶Although the hill of Gareb is only mentioned briefly in the Bible, its inclusion in Jeremiah's prophecy highlights the significance of Jerusalem's future restoration and the importance of its expanded boundaries.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gath, one of the five major Philistine cities, was the hometown of Goliath and a place of refuge for David during his flight from Saul.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gath was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, along with Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron (Joshua 13:3). It was located in the coastal plain of Philistia, near the border with Judah. The city is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Gath was one of the last strongholds of the Anakim, a race of giants (Joshua 11:22). The city gained prominence as the hometown of Goliath, the giant warrior who was defeated by David in single combat (1 Samuel 17:4, 23). ¶Gath played a significant role in the life of David. When fleeing from King Saul, David sought refuge in Gath, where he pretended to be insane to avoid arousing suspicion (1 Samuel 21:10-15). Later, David returned to Gath and served under King Achish, who gave him the town of Ziklag (1 Samuel 27:2-6). ¶The city was captured by David during his reign as king (1 Chronicles 18:1), and it was also attacked by later Israelite kings, such as Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6) and Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:8). The term &quot;Gittite&quot; is used to refer to people from Gath, such as Obed-Edom, in whose house the Ark of the Covenant was temporarily kept (2 Samuel 6:10-11). ¶Gath is also mentioned in prophetic texts, such as Amos 6:2 and Micah 1:10, which speak of the city's destruction and the fate of its inhabitants. The exact location of Gath is uncertain, but it is believed to be Tell es-Safi, an archaeological site in modern-day Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gath-hepher, a town in the territory of Zebulun, was the hometown of the prophet Jonah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gath-hepher is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the territory of Zebulun, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. It is primarily known as the hometown of the prophet Jonah, who was called by God to preach to the people of Nineveh (2 Kings 14:25). ¶The town is first mentioned in Joshua 19:13, where it is listed among the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Zebulun during the division of the Promised Land. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Lower Galilee, near the border with Asher. ¶Apart from being the birthplace of Jonah, no other significant events or individuals are associated with Gath-hepher in the Bible. The mention of Jonah's origins in 2 Kings 14:25 serves to provide background information about the prophet and to emphasize his Israelite heritage. ¶The name Gath-hepher is composed of two elements: &quot;Gath,&quot; meaning &quot;winepress,&quot; and &quot;hepher,&quot; which may be derived from a root meaning &quot;to dig&quot; or &quot;to explore.&quot; This suggests that the town may have been known for its wine production or its location near a significant well or water source.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gath-rimmon, a Levitical city, was allotted to the Kohathite Levites within the territories of Dan and Manasseh.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gath-rimmon is mentioned in the Bible as a Levitical city, one of the towns set apart for the Levites to live in among the various tribal territories of Israel. The city is associated with two different tribes: Dan and Manasseh. ¶In Joshua 19:45, Gath-rimmon is listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Dan in the coastal plain of Canaan. Later, in Joshua 21:24 and 1 Chronicles 6:69, it is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Dan. ¶However, in the parallel passage of 1 Chronicles 6:70, Gath-rimmon is also listed among the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Manasseh. This apparent discrepancy may be due to textual errors or could indicate that there were two cities named Gath-rimmon, one in Dan and another in Manasseh. ¶The Levites, who were not given a specific territorial inheritance like the other tribes, were distributed among the various tribes to serve as priests, teachers, and judges. The Levitical cities, such as Gath-rimmon, provided them with places to live and pasture lands for their livestock. ¶The name Gath-rimmon is composed of two elements: &quot;Gath,&quot; meaning &quot;winepress,&quot; and &quot;rimmon,&quot; which can mean &quot;pomegranate&quot; or &quot;thunderbolt.&quot; This suggests that the city may have been known for its wine production or its location near a prominent pomegranate grove or a place associated with thunderstorms.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gaza, one of the five major Philistine cities, was the site of Samson's exploits and a place visited by Philip the evangelist in the early church.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gaza, also known as Ayyah, was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, along with Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron (Joshua 13:3). Located in the southwestern coastal plain of Canaan, Gaza was situated near the border with Egypt and served as an important trade center. ¶The city is first mentioned in Genesis 10:19 as part of the description of the Canaanite territories. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua defeated the king of Gaza (Joshua 10:41), but the city remained under Philistine control (Joshua 11:22). ¶Gaza is perhaps best known for its association with Samson, the Israelite judge with extraordinary strength. Samson visited Gaza and fell in love with a Philistine woman named Delilah (Judges 16:1). Later, after being betrayed by Delilah and captured by the Philistines, Samson was imprisoned in Gaza and ultimately brought down the temple of Dagon, killing himself and many Philistines (Judges 16:21-30). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Gaza is mentioned in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines (Judges 6:4; 1 Samuel 6:17) and as a target of prophetic judgment (Jeremiah 47:5; Amos 1:6-7; Zephaniah 2:4; Zechariah 9:5). ¶In the New Testament, Gaza is mentioned in Acts 8:26, where an angel directs Philip the evangelist to travel on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza. Along this road, Philip encounters an Ethiopian eunuch and shares the gospel with him, leading to the eunuch's conversion and baptism. ¶The name Gaza is believed to be derived from the Hebrew root meaning &quot;to be strong&quot; or &quot;to be fierce,&quot; possibly reflecting the city's reputation as a well-fortified and powerful center. The name Ayyah, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 7:28, is thought to be an alternate name for Gaza or a nearby town.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Geba, a Levitical city in the territory of Benjamin, was located on the northern border of the kingdom of Judah (Joshua 18:24; 1 Kings 15:22).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Geba was a city located in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, situated on the northern border of the kingdom of Judah. It was assigned to the Levites as one of their cities (Joshua 21:17; 1 Chronicles 6:60). ¶Geba is first mentioned in the Bible during the time of King Saul, when Jonathan, Saul's son, attacked a Philistine garrison stationed there (1 Samuel 13:3). Later, during the reign of King Asa of Judah, Geba was fortified using materials from Ramah, which Asa had destroyed (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). ¶After the Babylonian exile, Geba was one of the cities resettled by the returning Israelites (Ezra 2:26; Nehemiah 7:30). It was also mentioned as a city inhabited by the Levites and singers (Nehemiah 11:31; 12:29). ¶The prophet Isaiah mentions Geba in a prophecy concerning the advance of the Assyrian army towards Jerusalem (Isaiah 10:29). In a future prophecy, Zechariah declares that the land will be inhabited from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, indicating the extent of the restored land (Zechariah 14:10). ¶Geba's location on the northern border of Judah made it a strategically important city throughout Israel's history, serving as a defensive outpost and a Levitical city.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gebal, a Phoenician city known for its skilled builders, was allied against Israel and provided materials for Solomon's temple.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gebal, also known as Byblos, was an important Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast, north of modern-day Beirut. The city is mentioned in several contexts in the Bible, highlighting its significance in the region. ¶In Ezekiel 27:9, Gebal is described as a source of skilled shipbuilders and wise men who helped repair the ships of Tyre, indicating the city's reputation for craftsmanship and maritime expertise. The &quot;elders&quot; and &quot;wise men&quot; of Gebal are specifically mentioned as being employed on Tyrian ships. ¶Gebal is also listed in Psalm 83:7 among the nations that formed a coalition against Israel, along with Edom, Moab, and others. This suggests that Gebal, at times, was hostile towards Israel and aligned with its enemies. ¶However, in 1 Kings 5:18, the Gebalites (people of Gebal) are mentioned alongside the Sidonians as skilled stonecutters who helped prepare the stones for the construction of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. This indicates that Gebal also had a role in providing materials and labor for this important project. ¶The city of Gebal has a long history, with evidence of occupation dating back to the Bronze Age. It was an important center of trade and religion, particularly associated with the worship of the goddess Baalat Gebal. The city's strategic location and its valuable resources, such as cedar wood and skilled artisans, made it a significant player in the region's political and economic landscape.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gebim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Isaiah 10:31, as part of a prophetic description of the Assyrian army's advance towards Jerusalem. The passage lists several towns and cities in the region of Benjamin that would be affected by the invasion. ¶According to Isaiah's prophecy, the inhabitants of Gebim are described as fleeing, suggesting that the town was in the path of the advancing Assyrian forces and that its people sought to escape the impending danger. ¶The exact location of Gebim is uncertain, but based on its mention alongside other towns in Benjamin, such as Anathoth and Nob, it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly in the vicinity of Ramah. ¶The name &quot;Gebim&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;cisterns&quot; or &quot;trenches,&quot; which may indicate that the town was known for its water storage facilities or its location near a series of trenches or ravines. ¶Apart from this single reference in Isaiah, no other information about Gebim is provided in the Bible. Its mention serves to illustrate the widespread fear and disruption caused by the Assyrian invasion and to underscore the imminent threat to Jerusalem and the surrounding region.</ext_description>

It is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in Joshua 15:36, along with other nearby settlements such as Socoh, Azekah, and Shaaraim. ¶In 1 Chronicles 4:23, Gederah is described as a place where the potters and those who dwelt among plants and hedges resided, suggesting that the town was known for its pottery production and agricultural activities. ¶Gederah is also associated with two individuals who served under King David. In 1 Chronicles 27:28, Baal-hanan the Gederite is mentioned as one of David's overseers in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah region, indicating that he likely hailed from Gederah. ¶Additionally, in 1 Chronicles 12:4, Jozabad the Gederathite is listed among David's mighty men who joined him at Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul. This suggests that Jozabad was a skilled warrior from Gederah who pledged his allegiance to David. ¶The exact location of Gederah is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gederoth is mentioned in the Bible as a town located in the Shephelah, or lowland region, of Judah. It is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in Joshua 15:41, along with other nearby settlements such as Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah. ¶The town is most notably mentioned in 2 Chronicles 28:18 in the context of the reign of King Ahaz of Judah. During this time, the Philistines, taking advantage of Judah's weakened state, launched an invasion and captured several towns in the Shephelah, including Gederoth, Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon. They also attacked the Negev region and settled in the captured towns. ¶The Philistine conquest of Gederoth and other towns in the Shephelah demonstrates the vulnerability of Judah's borders and the ongoing threat posed by its neighboring enemies. It also highlights the consequences of Ahaz's unfaithfulness to God and his failure to protect the kingdom from foreign invaders. ¶The exact location of Gederoth is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

It is listed alongside other towns such as Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah. ¶The name &quot;Gederothaim&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;geder,&quot; meaning &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;fence,&quot; with the dual ending &quot;-aim,&quot; indicating that the town may have consisted of two parts or had a double wall. ¶Apart from its inclusion in the list of allotted towns, no other information about Gederothaim is provided in the Bible. Its mention serves to delineate the extent of Judah's territory and to emphasize the thoroughness of the allotment process. ¶The exact location of Gederothaim is unknown, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other towns mentioned in the same list, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem. ¶The lack of further biblical references to Gederothaim suggests that it may have been a relatively small or less significant settlement compared to other towns in the region. However, its inclusion in the allotment list underscores the importance of each town, regardless of size, in the distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gedor, a region where some Simeonites went to find pasture for their flocks during the reign of King Hezekiah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>In 1 Chronicles 4:39, Gedor is mentioned as a region where some members of the tribe of Simeon went to find pasture for their flocks during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. This Gedor is likely a different location from the town of Gedor mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. ¶According to the text, the Simeonites, faced with a shortage of pasture for their growing herds, traveled to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, in search of suitable grazing land. They found rich and good pasture there, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful, as some of the descendants of Ham had previously settled there. ¶The Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, attacked and defeated the Hamites and Meunites who inhabited the region, destroying them completely. They then settled in the area themselves, as it provided ample pasture for their flocks. ¶This event took place during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which suggests that it occurred sometime between 715 and 686 BC. The Simeonites' search for new pasture lands reflects the challenges faced by pastoral communities in ancient Israel and their willingness to migrate and engage in conflict to secure resources for their livestock. ¶The specific location of this Gedor is uncertain, but it is described as being to the east of a valley and having been previously inhabited by descendants of Ham, suggesting that it may have been situated in the Negev region or beyond, possibly in the direction of Edom or Sinai.</ext_description>

Additionally, in 1 Chronicles 4:18, Jered, the father of Gedor, is listed among the descendants of Ezrah, another member of the tribe of Judah. ¶Gedor is also associated with some of the mighty men who joined David at Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul. In 1 Chronicles 12:7, Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor, are mentioned among the Benjamite warriors who came to David's aid. ¶In Joshua 12:13, Geder is mentioned in the context of the kings defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. The king of Geder is listed among the thirty-one kings who were conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. ¶The exact location of Gedor is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the hill country of Judah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated southwest of Jerusalem, possibly near the modern-day village of Khirbet Jedur.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ge-harashim, the Valley of Craftsmen, was inhabited by some Benjamites after the return from the Babylonian exile.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ge-harashim, which means &quot;Valley of Craftsmen&quot; in Hebrew, is mentioned in two passages in the Bible. In 1 Chronicles 4:14, Joab, the father of Ge-harashim, is listed among the descendants of Judah, specifically from the clan of Othniel. This suggests that the valley was associated with skilled artisans and craftsmen from the tribe of Judah. ¶In Nehemiah 11:35, Ge-harashim is mentioned again, this time in the context of the resettlement of Jerusalem and the surrounding towns after the Babylonian exile. The passage states that some of the Benjamites, along with people from Judah, settled in various towns, including Ge-harashim. ¶The mention of Benjamites settling in Ge-harashim during the post-exilic period indicates that the valley had become a place of residence for people from different tribes, particularly those known for their craftsmanship and artisanal skills. ¶The exact location of Ge-harashim is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, it is believed to have been situated somewhere in the Judean hill country, possibly near Jerusalem or in the Shephelah region. ¶The name &quot;Valley of Craftsmen&quot; suggests that the area was known for its concentration of skilled artisans, possibly including metalworkers, potters, weavers, and other craftsmen. The presence of such a community would have been important for the economic and cultural life of the region, both before and after the Babylonian exile.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gennesaret, also known as the Plain of Gennesaret or the Land of Gennesaret, is a fertile region located on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels in connection with several events in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. ¶In Matthew 14:34 and Mark 6:53, Gennesaret is described as the place where Jesus and his disciples landed after crossing the Sea of Galilee, following the miraculous feeding of the five thousand and Jesus walking on water. Upon landing, the people of the region recognized Jesus and brought the sick to him to be healed. ¶Luke 5:1 mentions the Lake of Gennesaret as the location where Jesus taught the crowds from Simon Peter's boat and performed the miraculous catch of fish, leading to the calling of Peter, James, and John as his disciples. ¶The Plain of Gennesaret is known for its fertile soil and mild climate, which allow for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In ancient times, the region was famous for its wheat, barley, melons, figs, and other fruits. The area was also known for its fishing industry, as the Sea of Galilee was rich in fish. ¶The exact extent of the Plain of Gennesaret is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally believed to have stretched from the town of Capernaum in the north to the town of Magdala in the south, covering an area of approximately 3 miles long and 1 mile wide (5 km by 1.6 km). ¶The region's fertility and its proximity to the Sea of Galilee made it an important agricultural and economic center in ancient times. The mention of Gennesaret in the Gospels highlights the significance of the area in the context of Jesus' ministry and the impact of his teachings and miracles on the local population.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gerasa (or Gadara), a region southeast of the Sea of Galilee, was the location where Jesus healed a demon-possessed man.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gerasa (or Gadara) is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels as the region where Jesus performed a notable miracle, healing a man (or two men, according to Matthew) who was possessed by demons. The accounts of this event are found in Mark 5:1, Luke 8:26-37, and Matthew 8:28-34. ¶According to the Gospel narratives, after crossing the Sea of Galilee, Jesus and his disciples arrived in the region of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes). There, they encountered a man (or two men) who was possessed by demons and lived among the tombs. The demon-possessed man was extremely violent and could not be restrained, even with chains. ¶When Jesus commanded the demons to come out of the man, they begged him to send them into a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus granted their request, and the demons entered the pigs, causing the herd to rush down a steep bank into the Sea of Galilee and drown. The man (or men) was then found sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind. ¶The exact location of this event is somewhat uncertain, as there are textual variations in the Gospels regarding the name of the place. Some manuscripts mention the region of the Gerasenes, while others refer to the Gadarenes. Gerasa (modern-day Jerash) was a city located about 37 miles (60 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee, while Gadara (modern-day Umm Qais) was a city located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee. The discrepancy in the location has led to various explanations: ¶1) The region of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes may have extended to the Sea of Galilee, even though the cities were some distance away. The &quot;country of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes&quot; could refer to a wider area around these cities. ¶2) There may have been a small town called Gergesa or Gersa near the Sea of Galilee, which was part of the larger region of the Gerasenes or Gadarenes. Some ancient manuscripts mention the &quot;Gergesenes,&quot; possibly referring to this town. ¶3) The gospel writers may have used the names of the larger, more well-known cities to help their readers understand the general location, even if the exact site was closer to the Sea of Galilee. ¶4) Matthew, writing primarily to a Jewish audience, may have used &quot;Gadarenes&quot; because Gadara was a prominent city in the region, while Mark and Luke, writing to Gentile audiences, used &quot;Gerasenes&quot; as Gerasa was an important Gentile city. ¶Despite the variations in the place names, the gospel accounts agree that the healing of the demoniac took place on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in a predominantly Gentile region. The presence of pigs, considered unclean by Jews, further confirms the Gentile character of the area.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Gerizim, a mountain in Samaria, was designated as the site for pronouncing blessings and was the location of Jotham's parable to the men of Shechem.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Gerizim is a mountain located in Samaria, near the ancient city of Shechem. It is mentioned in the Bible as a place of significant events and religious importance. ¶In Deuteronomy 11:29 and 27:12, Moses instructed the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land, they were to pronounce blessings from Mount Gerizim and curses from Mount Ebal. This event took place under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in Joshua 8:33, where half of the tribes stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as the blessings and curses were read aloud. ¶Mount Gerizim is also associated with the parable of Jotham, son of Gideon, as recorded in Judges 9:7. After his brother Abimelech killed their seventy brothers and was made king by the men of Shechem, Jotham stood on top of Mount Gerizim and told a parable about the trees anointing a king over themselves. The parable was a warning against Abimelech's treachery and the folly of the men of Shechem in supporting him. ¶In later history, Mount Gerizim became a sacred site for the Samaritans, who built a temple there in the 5th century BC. They believed that Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem, was the chosen place for worship. This led to tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews, as evident in the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:20-21). ¶Today, Mount Gerizim, along with Mount Ebal, continues to be an important religious and archaeological site, with ruins of the Samaritan temple and other ancient structures still visible.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Geruth Chimham, a lodging place near Bethlehem, served as a temporary refuge for Johanan and his group after the murder of Gedaliah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Geruth Chimham is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Jeremiah 41:17, in the context of the events following the Babylonian conquest of Judah and the murder of Gedaliah, the appointed governor. ¶After Gedaliah was assassinated by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, a group of leaders led by Johanan, son of Kareah, pursued Ishmael and rescued the captives he had taken. Fearing retaliation from the Babylonians for Gedaliah's murder, Johanan and his group, along with the rescued captives, sought refuge in Geruth Chimham, which was near Bethlehem. ¶The name &quot;Geruth Chimham&quot; suggests that it was a lodging place or caravanserai associated with someone named Chimham. Some scholars believe that this Chimham may have been the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who is mentioned in 2 Samuel 19:37-40 as having provided for King David during his flight from Absalom. David, in return, offered to care for Chimham and allow him to return to Jerusalem with him. ¶If this connection is accurate, it is possible that David granted Chimham a piece of land near Bethlehem, where he established a lodging place for travelers. This would explain why Johanan and his group sought refuge there, as it was a known and established location. ¶The mention of Geruth Chimham in Jeremiah 41:17 highlights the chaos and fear that followed the Babylonian conquest and the murder of Gedaliah, as well as the desperate measures taken by those seeking to escape potential retribution. It also provides a glimpse into the practice of establishing lodging places for travelers in ancient times.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Geshur, an Aramean kingdom ruled by Talmai, was the homeland of David's wife Maacah and a refuge for Absalom after he murdered his half-brother Amnon.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Geshur was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Bashan. It bordered the Israelite territories of Manasseh and Maacah, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:14 and Joshua 12:5; 13:11. ¶The kingdom of Geshur played a significant role in the life of King David and his family. David married Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (2 Samuel 3:3; 1 Chronicles 3:2). Maacah was the mother of Absalom and Tamar, two of David's children who were involved in a tragic family conflict. ¶After Absalom murdered his half-brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of his sister Tamar, he fled to Geshur and sought refuge with his grandfather, King Talmai (2 Samuel 13:37-38). Absalom remained in Geshur for three years before Joab, David's commander, arranged for his return to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 14:23,32). ¶Later, when Absalom rebelled against his father David, he went to Geshur to gather support and raise an army (2 Samuel 15:8). This suggests that Absalom maintained ties with his maternal grandfather's kingdom and used it as a base for his political ambitions. ¶In Joshua 13:13, it is mentioned that the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites, indicating that they coexisted with the Aramean kingdom. However, during the reign of Solomon, it seems that Geshur came under Israelite control, as 1 Chronicles 2:23 mentions that Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took Geshur and Aram and their towns. ¶The biblical narrative portrays Geshur as an independent Aramean kingdom that had close ties with the Israelite royal family through marriage alliances. Its location and political significance made it a place of refuge and a potential source of support for those involved in the power struggles within the Israelite monarchy.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gethsemane is the name of a garden located at the foot of the Mount of Olives, just outside Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels as the place where Jesus went to pray and was later arrested before his crucifixion. ¶The name &quot;Gethsemane&quot; is derived from the Aramaic words &quot;gat shemanim,&quot; meaning &quot;oil press,&quot; suggesting that the garden may have contained an olive press or was located in an area known for olive oil production. ¶According to Matthew 26:36 and Mark 14:32, after the Last Supper, Jesus went with his disciples to Gethsemane. He took Peter, James, and John with him and asked them to stay awake and pray while he went further into the garden to pray alone. In his agony, Jesus prayed, &quot;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will&quot; (Matthew 26:39). ¶During his prayer, Jesus was deeply distressed and sorrowful, to the point of sweating drops of blood (Luke 22:44). This intense emotional and spiritual struggle underscores the significance of Gethsemane as the place where Jesus fully embraced his impending suffering and death. After his prayer, Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot and arrested.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gezer, also known as Gob, was a Canaanite city conquered by Joshua and later by David, and it was fortified by Solomon (Joshua 10:33; 12:12; 16:3, 10; 21:21; Judges 1:29; 2 Samuel 5:25; 21:18-19; 1 Kings 9:15-17; 1 Chronicles 6:67; 7:28; 14:16; 20:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gezer, also referred to as Gob, was a significant Canaanite city located in the region allotted to the tribe of Ephraim. It was originally ruled by a Canaanite king, Horam, who came to the aid of Lachish but was defeated by Joshua (Joshua 10:33; 12:12). Although the city was assigned to the Levites (Joshua 21:21; 1 Chronicles 6:67), the Ephraimites failed to drive out the Canaanites, who continued to live there (Joshua 16:10; Judges 1:29). During the reign of David, the Israelites fought battles against the Philistines at Gob (Gezer), where David's warriors defeated the giants (2 Samuel 21:18-19; 1 Chronicles 20:4). David also defeated the Philistines from Geba to Gezer (2 Samuel 5:25; 1 Chronicles 14:16). Later, King Solomon fortified Gezer, along with other key cities, using the labor of the Canaanites (1 Kings 9:15-17). Gezer is mentioned as part of the inheritance of the descendants of Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:28). The city's strategic location and its history of Canaanite occupation make it a significant site in the narratives of the conquest and establishment of Israel in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Giah was a place near Gibeon where Joab and Abishai pursued Abner after the battle at the pool of Gibeon.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Giah is a location mentioned only once in the Bible, in 2 Samuel 2:24. It was situated near Gibeon, a prominent city in Benjamin's territory just north of Jerusalem. ¶The context of the reference to Giah is the aftermath of a battle between the forces of David and Ishbosheth, Saul's son, at the pool of Gibeon. Abner, the commander of Ishbosheth's army, was retreating after being defeated. Joab and Abishai, David's generals and brothers, pursued Abner and his men. ¶The text states that the pursuit continued &quot;on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon&quot; and that &quot;the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon&quot; (2 Samuel 2:24, ESV). ¶No further details are provided about Giah. It seems to have been a known landmark on the road from Gibeon toward the wilderness area to the east. The mention of the &quot;hill of Ammah&quot; suggests Giah was located in hilly terrain. ¶Apart from this single reference, Giah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in any known extra-biblical sources. Its exact location remains unknown, though it can be generally placed in the vicinity of Gibeon, probably to the east.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gibbethon, a Levitical city in the territory of Dan, was the site of conflict during the reigns of Nadab and Baasha (Joshua 19:44; 21:23; 1 Kings 15:27; 16:15, 17).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gibbethon was a city allotted to the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:44) and designated as a Levitical city for the descendants of Kohath (Joshua 21:23). The city gained prominence during the period of the Divided Monarchy, particularly during the reigns of Nadab and Baasha, kings of Israel. Nadab, the son of Jeroboam I, was besieging Gibbethon when he was assassinated by Baasha (1 Kings 15:27). Later, during the reign of Baasha's son Elah, the Israelite army was again besieging Gibbethon when Zimri, a commander of chariots, conspired against Elah and killed him (1 Kings 16:15). The siege of Gibbethon by the Israelite army suggests that the city may have been under Philistine control at the time. These events highlight the strategic importance of Gibbethon and its role in the power struggles within the Northern Kingdom of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gibeah was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:57). It is mentioned briefly in the context of the cities and villages assigned to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua. The exact location of this Gibeah is uncertain, as there are several places with the same name mentioned in the Bible. In 2 Chronicles 13:2, Gibeah is identified as the hometown of Maacah (also known as Micaiah), the mother of King Abijah of Judah. Abijah was the son of Rehoboam and succeeded him as king.

		<short_description>Gibeah, a city of Benjamin, was the hometown of Saul and the site of infamous atrocities during the time of the judges (Joshua 18:28; 24:33; Judges 19-20; 1 Samuel 10:5, 10, 26; 11:4; 13:2, 15; 14:2, 16; 15:34; 22:6; 23:19; 26:1; 2 Samuel 21:6; 23:29; 1 Chronicles 11:31; 12:3; Isaiah 10:29; Hosea 5:8; 9:9; 10:9).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gibeah was a city located in the territory of Benjamin, often associated with King Saul and the infamous atrocities that occurred there during the period of the judges. It was the hometown and burial place of Eleazar, the son of Aaron (Joshua 24:33). Gibeah is infamously known for the horrific incident involving the concubine of a Levite, which led to a civil war between the Benjamites and the other tribes of Israel (Judges 19-20). The city was also the birthplace and residence of Saul, the first king of Israel (1 Samuel 10:26; 15:34). Saul and his son Jonathan used Gibeah as a base of operations during their battles against the Philistines (1 Samuel 13:2, 15; 14:2, 16). The city is mentioned in the context of David's flight from Saul (1 Samuel 22:6; 23:19; 26:1) and in the account of the hanging of Saul's descendants (2 Samuel 21:6). Gibeah is also listed among the cities of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28; 1 Chronicles 12:3) and is mentioned in prophetic passages (Isaiah 10:29; Hosea 5:8; 9:9; 10:9). The atrocities committed at Gibeah became a byword for the moral decay and lawlessness of the time, serving as a warning and a call to repentance for future generations.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gibeath-elohim, also known as the &quot;Hill of God,&quot; was a place mentioned in the account of Saul's anointing as king of Israel. It was located near the city of Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin. The name &quot;Gibeath-elohim&quot; suggests that it may have been a site of religious significance or a place associated with divine presence. According to 1 Samuel 10:5, there was a garrison of Philistines stationed at Gibeath-elohim. This detail indicates that the Philistines, who were the dominant power in the region at the time, had established a military presence there. The presence of the Philistine garrison at Gibeath-elohim highlights the oppression and control that the Israelites were subjected to before the establishment of the monarchy under Saul. Its location remains unknown.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gibeon was a prominent Hivite city that deceived Joshua into making a peace treaty, and later became a Levitical city and site of worship.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gibeon was a significant city in ancient Israel, located in the territory of Benjamin, about 6 miles northwest of Jerusalem. It was inhabited by Hivites, a Canaanite people group. ¶When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, the Gibeonites tricked them into making a peace treaty by pretending to be from a distant land (Joshua 9:3-15). Despite the deception, Joshua honored the treaty when the truth was discovered. ¶Gibeon's importance is underscored by the fact that its king, Hoham, led a coalition of five Amorite kings against Israel (Joshua 10:1-5). In response, Joshua asked God for the sun to stand still during the ensuing battle, allowing Israel to defeat the coalition (Joshua 10:12-14). ¶After the conquest, Gibeon was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin and designated as a Levitical city (Joshua 18:25, 21:17). The tabernacle was set up at Gibeon for a period, and it became a major worship center (1 Chronicles 16:39, 21:29).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gidom was a place mentioned in the context of the Benjamite War, a conflict that arose after the horrific incident involving the concubine of a Levite at Gibeah. During the battle between the Israelite tribes and the Benjamites, the Benjamites were initially successful in repelling the attacks. However, the Israelites set an ambush and lured the Benjamites away from Gibeah. As the Benjamites were retreating, they were pursued by the Israelites on the road to Gidom (Judges 20:45). The Israelites overtook the Benjamites and defeated them, striking down many of them. The reference to Gidom suggests that it was a known location near Gibeah, possibly on the route of the Benjamites' retreat. Apart from this single mention, no further details about Gidom are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gihon is the name given to two different water sources in the Bible. First, it is mentioned as one of the four rivers that flowed from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:13). The exact location of this river is unknown, and there is no further information provided about it in the biblical text. Second, Gihon is the name of a spring located near Jerusalem, which played a significant role in the city's water supply and in the anointing of King Solomon. It was at the Gihon spring that Solomon was anointed as king by the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan (1 Kings 1:33, 38, 45). King Hezekiah later directed the waters of the Gihon spring through a tunnel to the west side of the City of David, ensuring a reliable water supply for Jerusalem during times of siege (2 Chronicles 32:30). King Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, built a wall outside the City of David, extending it to the west of the Gihon spring (2 Chronicles 33:14). The Gihon spring's location and its importance for Jerusalem's water supply make it a significant site in the city's history and in the narratives of the Israelite monarchy.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Gilboa was the site of a battle where Saul and his sons were killed by the Philistines (1 Samuel 28:4; 2 Samuel 1:21; 21:12).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Gilboa is a mountain range located in northern Israel, southwest of the Sea of Galilee. It is most notably associated with the final battle and death of King Saul and his sons. The Philistines had gathered their forces at Shunem, while Saul and the Israelite army camped on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 28:4). In the ensuing battle, the Philistines fought fiercely against Israel, and Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 31:1-6). After the battle, the Philistines found the bodies of Saul and his sons and fastened them to the wall of Beth-shan (1 Samuel 31:10). Later, valiant men from Jabesh-gilead retrieved the bodies and buried them (1 Samuel 31:11-13; 2 Samuel 21:12). In his lament for Saul and Jonathan, David cursed the mountains of Gilboa, expressing his grief over their deaths (2 Samuel 1:21). The events at Mount Gilboa marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David to become king over Israel. The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic fate of Saul and his sons and the transfer of power to the Davidic dynasty.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Gilboa was the site where Saul and his sons were killed in battle against the Philistines (1 Samuel 31:1, 8; 2 Samuel 1:6; 1 Chronicles 10:1, 8; Judges 7:3).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Gilboa is a mountain range located in northern Israel, near the ancient city of Jezreel. It is most famously known as the site where King Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed in battle against the Philistines. The Philistines had gathered their forces to fight against Israel, and the two armies met on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 31:1; 1 Chronicles 10:1). In the fierce battle that ensued, the Philistines prevailed, and Saul and his sons were slain on the mountain (1 Samuel 31:8; 1 Chronicles 10:8). The Philistines found their bodies the following day and desecrated them, displaying them on the walls of Beth-shan. The men of Jabesh-gilead later retrieved the bodies and buried them. Mount Gilboa is also mentioned in the account of Gideon's victory over the Midianites, where some of his fearful troops were allowed to depart from the mountain (Judges 7:3). The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic end of Saul's reign and the transfer of power to David, who would become Israel's next king.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gilead is a mountainous region east of the Jordan River, extending from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. It is characterized by rugged terrain, forests, and fertile valleys. ¶In the Old Testament, Gilead is often used to refer to the entire region east of the Jordan, which was allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh (Numbers 32:1-42; Joshua 13:24-31). The region was known for its balm, a medicinal resin (Jeremiah 8:22, 46:11).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gilgal, a place associated with the prophets Elijah and Elisha, was the starting point of Elijah's final journey and the location of a prophetic community (2 Kings 2:1; 4:38).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gilgal, mentioned in 2 Kings, was a place associated with the prophets Elijah and Elisha. It was from Gilgal that Elijah set out on his final journey before being taken up to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:1). Elisha, who had been anointed as Elijah's successor, returned to Gilgal after Elijah's departure. Later, during a time of famine, Elisha was in Gilgal with a group of prophets known as the &quot;sons of the prophets&quot; (2 Kings 4:38). While there, Elisha performed a miracle by making a poisonous stew edible, demonstrating his prophetic power and divine authority. This Gilgal seems to have been a location where a community of prophets lived and trained, possibly different from the Gilgal mentioned in the books of Joshua and Samuel. The exact location of this Gilgal is uncertain, but it was likely in the northern part of Israel, given its association with the prophetic ministries of Elijah and Elisha.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gilgal, also referred to as Geliloth, Beth-gilgal, or Gibeath-haaraloth, was a significant site during Israel's early history in Canaan. It was located in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. Gilgal served as the first campsite for the Israelites after they crossed the Jordan River under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 4:19-20). It was at Gilgal that the Israelites set up twelve memorial stones taken from the Jordan and where Joshua circumcised the new generation born in the wilderness (Joshua 5:3, 9). The Passover was also celebrated at Gilgal (Joshua 5:10). Gilgal served as a base of operations for Joshua during the conquest of Canaan, with the Gibeonites coming to seek a treaty there (Joshua 9:6) and Joshua launching campaigns against the Amorite kings from Gilgal (Joshua 10:6-9, 15, 43). Later, it became a place where the Israelites assembled and where Saul was confirmed as king (1 Samuel 11:14-15). Samuel included Gilgal in his circuit as a judge (1 Samuel 7:16). However, Gilgal also became associated with idolatrous worship, as evidenced by the prophets' condemnations (Hosea 4:15; 9:15; 12:11; Amos 4:4; 5:5). Despite its significance in Israel's history, Gilgal's importance declined over time.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Giloh, also referred to as Gilo, was a city located in the hill country of Judah, mentioned in the territorial allotment of the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:51). It is most notably known as the hometown of Ahithophel, a wise counselor who served King David (2 Samuel 23:34). However, during Absalom's rebellion against David, Ahithophel sided with Absalom and provided him with counsel (2 Samuel 15:12). Ahithophel's defection was a significant blow to David, given his reputation for wisdom and insight. When Absalom rejected Ahithophel's advice in favor of Hushai's counsel, Ahithophel returned to Giloh and hanged himself, perceiving that Absalom's cause was doomed (2 Samuel 17:23). Apart from its association with Ahithophel, little else is known about Giloh from the biblical text. Its mention in the narrative of Absalom's rebellion highlights the political and personal turmoil that David faced during his reign.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gimzo was a city in the plain of Judah that was captured by the Philistines during the reign of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:18).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gimzo was a city located in the plain of Judah, known for its abundance of sycamore trees. During the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, the Philistines attacked and captured Gimzo, along with its surrounding villages (2 Chronicles 28:18). This event occurred in the context of Ahaz's unfaithfulness to God and his refusal to seek divine help, which led to various military defeats and losses of territory. The capture of Gimzo by the Philistines demonstrates the vulnerability of Judah's cities and the consequences of the king's disobedience. Apart from this single reference, no further details about Gimzo's history or significance are provided in the Bible. The city is believed to be located at the site of modern-day Jimzu, approximately 3 miles southeast of Lydda.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gittaim is a town mentioned twice in the Old Testament. The first reference is in 2 Samuel 4:3, which states that the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and lived there as foreigners. This event is connected to the assassination of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, by two Beerothites (2 Samuel 4:5-8). ¶Beeroth was one of the four cities of the Gibeonites, who had deceived Joshua into making a peace treaty (Joshua 9:17). The flight of the Beerothites to Gittaim suggests that the town was a place of refuge, possibly located outside Israelite territory. ¶The second reference to Gittaim is in Nehemiah 11:33, which lists the towns inhabited by the Benjamites after their return from Babylonian exile. Gittaim is mentioned along with other towns in the region, indicating that it was resettled by the Benjamites during the post-exilic period. ¶The exact location of Gittaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in Benjamite territory, north of Jerusalem. Some scholars suggest it may be identified with modern-day Ras Abu Kharrubeh, about 6 miles northeast of Jerusalem. ¶Apart from these two brief references, no other information about Gittaim is provided in the Bible. Its significance lies in its connection to the Beerothites' flight and its later resettlement by the Benjamites.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Goah was a place near Jerusalem, mentioned in the context of a prophetic description of the city's future restoration (Jeremiah 31:39).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Goah is a place mentioned only once in the Bible, in the book of Jeremiah. The reference to Goah occurs within a prophetic passage describing the future restoration and expansion of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 31:39). According to the prophecy, the measuring line used to define the city's boundaries would extend as far as Goah. This suggests that Goah was located outside the city walls of Jerusalem at the time of Jeremiah's prophecy. The exact location of Goah is unknown, and no other biblical passages provide further information about this place. Its mention in the context of Jerusalem's restoration highlights the idea that the city would experience significant growth and expansion in the future, encompassing areas that were previously outside its limits.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gog is a name that appears in the prophetic literature of the Bible, particularly in the books of Ezekiel and Revelation. In Ezekiel, Gog is described as the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, lands associated with the regions of Asia Minor (Ezekiel 38:2, 3). Gog is portrayed as a powerful enemy who will lead a coalition of nations in an attack against Israel in the latter days (Ezekiel 38:14-16). However, God will intervene and defeat Gog and his armies, demonstrating His power and sovereignty (Ezekiel 38:18-23; 39:1-6). The prophecy also mentions that Gog's forces will be buried in a place called the Valley of Hamon-gog, and the land will be cleansed (Ezekiel 39:11-16). In the book of Revelation, Gog and Magog are mentioned together, representing the nations that will be deceived by Satan and gather for battle against God's people at the end of the millennial reign (Revelation 20:8). The names Gog and Magog are symbolic, representing the final enemies of God's kingdom who will be ultimately defeated. The prophecies concerning Gog emphasize God's sovereignty, the certainty of His judgment against His enemies, and the ultimate victory of His people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Golan was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, within the territory allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was designated as one of the six cities of refuge, along with Kedesh and Hebron (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8). These cities served as places of protection for individuals who had unintentionally killed someone, providing them with a safe haven from avengers of blood until a proper trial could be conducted. Golan was also allotted to the Levites of the family of Gershon, along with other cities in the region, as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This allocation of cities to the Levites ensured that they would be dispersed throughout the land and could carry out their priestly duties among the various tribes of Israel. The region surrounding Golan became known as the territory of Golan or Gaulonitis. Apart from its designation as a city of refuge and a Levitical city, no other specific events or details about Golan are recorded in the Bible.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Golgotha, also known as the Place of a Skull, was the site outside Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified (Matthew 27:33; Mark 15:22; Luke 23:33; John 19:17).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Golgotha, which means &quot;Place of a Skull&quot; in Aramaic, was the location outside the walls of Jerusalem where Jesus Christ was crucified. All four Gospels mention Golgotha as the site of the crucifixion (Matthew 27:33; Mark 15:22; Luke 23:33; John 19:17). The exact reason for the name is not specified in the Bible, but it may refer to the physical appearance of the site, resembling a skull, or it could be associated with a place of execution. The Gospel accounts describe how Jesus, after being sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, was led to Golgotha, where he was crucified along with two criminals. The location of Golgotha was outside the city walls, as was customary for executions in ancient times. It is also mentioned that the site was near a garden and a tomb, which belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, where Jesus' body was later laid (John 19:41-42). The crucifixion at Golgotha is the central event in the Christian faith, as it represents Jesus' sacrificial death for the sins of humanity, leading to his resurrection and the offer of salvation to all who believe in him.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Gomorrah was a wicked city in the plain of Jordan that God destroyed with sulfur and fire, along with Sodom, due to their grave sins.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Gomorrah was one of the five cities in the plain of Jordan, along with Sodom, Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar (Genesis 10:19, 14:2). It was located in a fertile area, well-watered like the garden of the Lord (Genesis 13:10). ¶However, the wickedness of Gomorrah and the neighboring cities was exceedingly grave (Genesis 18:20). When God revealed His plan to destroy the cities to Abraham, the patriarch pleaded for their survival if even ten righteous people could be found (Genesis 18:23-32). Ultimately, only Lot and his two daughters were spared, while Gomorrah and the other cities were destroyed by sulfur and fire from heaven (Genesis 19:24-25). ¶The destruction of Gomorrah and Sodom became a symbol of God's judgment against sin and a warning to future generations (Deuteronomy 29:23, 32:32; Isaiah 1:9-10, 13:19; Jeremiah 23:14, 49:18, 50:40; Amos 4:11; Zephaniah 2:9). In the New Testament, Jesus used Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the fate awaiting those who reject the gospel message (Matthew 10:15; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:12). ¶The apostle Peter cited the destruction of these cities as proof of God's judgment against the ungodly and His deliverance of the righteous (2 Peter 2:6-9). Jude also referred to Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the punishment awaiting those who indulge in sexual immorality and perversion (Jude 1:7). ¶The exact location of Gomorrah remains unknown, as the cities were completely destroyed. However, it is believed to have been situated in the area south of the Dead Sea, possibly submerged beneath its waters.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Goshen was the region in Egypt where Jacob and his family settled during the time of Joseph, and where the Israelites lived and prospered until the Exodus (Genesis 45:10; 46:28-29, 34; 47:1, 4, 6, 27; 50:8; Exodus 8:22; 9:26).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Goshen was a fertile region in the eastern Nile Delta of Egypt, where Jacob and his family settled during the time of Joseph. When Joseph, as a high official in Egypt, invited his father and brothers to come to Egypt due to the famine in Canaan, he suggested that they settle in Goshen (Genesis 45:10). Jacob sent Judah ahead to meet Joseph and be directed to Goshen (Genesis 46:28-29). The Israelites presented themselves to Pharaoh and requested to settle in Goshen as shepherds (Genesis 46:34; 47:1, 4). Pharaoh granted their request and allowed them to live in the best part of the land of Goshen (Genesis 47:6). The Israelites prospered and multiplied greatly in Goshen (Genesis 47:27). During the plagues that God sent upon Egypt, Goshen was spared from the swarms of flies and the plague of hail (Exodus 8:22; 9:26). At the time of the Exodus, the Israelites left Egypt from the region of Goshen (Genesis 50:8). The exact location of Goshen is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, possibly in the Wadi Tumilat area.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gozan was a region located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) to which Israelite captives from the northern kingdom were deported by the Assyrians. During the reign of King Hoshea of Israel, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser conquered Samaria and carried away the Israelites to Assyria, placing them in various cities, including Halah, Habor, and the cities of the Medes, by the river Gozan (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11; 1 Chronicles 5:26). The Assyrian practice of deporting conquered populations was a means of controlling and assimilating them into the Assyrian Empire. The exact location of Gozan is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be associated with the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates River in northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey. The name Gozan is also mentioned in the context of Sennacherib's boasting about the Assyrian conquests, where he claims that the gods of the nations, including those of Gozan, could not deliver their lands from his power (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12). The deportation of the Israelites to Gozan and other regions marked the end of the northern kingdom of Israel and the beginning of the Assyrian exile.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Great Sea, also known as the Sea of the Philistines, refers to the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:6-7; Joshua 1:4; 9:1; 15:12, 47; 23:4; Ezekiel 47:10, 15, 19-20; 48:28; Exodus 23:31).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Great Sea, also referred to as the Sea of the Philistines, is the biblical name for the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the Promised Land. In the description of the boundaries of the land allocated to the Israelites, the Great Sea is mentioned as the western limit (Numbers 34:6-7; Joshua 15:12; Ezekiel 47:20). The extent of the Promised Land is described as reaching from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River (Exodus 23:31). The Great Sea played a significant role in the history and geography of the region, with many important cities and ports located along its coast. The Philistines, who were a major enemy of the Israelites, occupied the coastal plain along the Great Sea (Joshua 9:1; 15:47). In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, the Great Sea is mentioned in the context of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:10, 15, 19; 48:28). The Mediterranean Sea was a vital trade route and a source of resources for the ancient civilizations that inhabited the region, including the Israelites, Phoenicians, and Greeks.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Greece (Javan), a nation and culture mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Greece, also known as Javan in the Old Testament, is mentioned several times in the Bible. In the book of Daniel, Greece is symbolized by a male goat in a vision (Daniel 8:21) and is described as a kingdom that will rise after Persia (Daniel 10:20; 11:2). The prophet Zechariah speaks of Judah being like a bow and Ephraim like an arrow against Greece (Zechariah 9:13). Greece is also listed among the nations to which God will send survivors to proclaim His glory (Isaiah 66:19). In Ezekiel's prophecy, Javan is mentioned as a trading partner of Tyre, providing slaves and bronze vessels (Ezekiel 27:13,19). ¶In the New Testament, Greece is mentioned as a region visited by Paul during his missionary journeys (Acts 20:2). The term &quot;Hellenist&quot; is used to describe Greek-speaking Jews who had adopted Greek culture (Acts 6:1; 9:29; 11:20). These references highlight the significant influence of Greek culture and language in the ancient world, as well as the tension between Greek and Jewish cultures during the time of the early church.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Guard Gate was a gate in Jerusalem's wall, mentioned in Nehemiah 12:39, likely the same as the Muster Gate near the Temple.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Guard Gate, also known as the Prison Gate in the King James Version, was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Nehemiah 12:39, during the description of the dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. ¶During this dedication, Nehemiah divided the leaders of Judah into two large choirs. One choir proceeded on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate (Nehemiah 12:31). The second choir, which included Nehemiah, went to the left. They marched on the wall past several gates and towers, including the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, and the Sheep Gate, until they stopped at the Guard Gate (Nehemiah 12:38-39). ¶Based on its location in the description of the procession, the Guard Gate appears to have been situated on the eastern side of the city, near the Temple area. Many scholars believe it to be the same gate as the Muster Gate or Inspection Gate, mentioned in Nehemiah 3:31 as being near the Temple. ¶The exact purpose of this gate is not specified in the biblical text. Its name suggests it may have been a point where guards were stationed or where prisoners were kept, but this is not stated explicitly. It could also possibly refer to a place where people or goods were inspected before entering the city or Temple precincts. ¶Apart from this single reference in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about the Guard Gate in the Bible. Its mention in the context of the wall's dedication ceremony highlights its significance as part of Jerusalem's fortifications during the post-exilic period.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Gur is a place mentioned briefly in the account of the death of Ahaziah, king of Judah. After Jehu had killed Joram, king of Israel, Ahaziah fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu pursued Ahaziah and ordered his men to shoot him in his chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam (2 Kings 9:27). Ahaziah was wounded there and managed to escape to Megiddo, where he died. The exact location of Gur is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as being near Ibleam, a town in the territory of Manasseh, near the border with Issachar. Apart from this single reference in the context of Ahaziah's death, no further information about Gur is provided in the Bible.

		<ext_description>Gurbaal is a place mentioned in the context of King Uzziah's military campaigns. During his reign, Uzziah waged war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of several of their cities. He also fought against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites (2 Chronicles 26:7). The exact location of Gurbaal is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as a place inhabited by Arabians, suggesting that it was likely located in the region southeast of Judah, possibly in the Negev or the Sinai Peninsula. Uzziah's success against the Arabians in Gurbaal demonstrates his military prowess and the extent of his kingdom's influence during his reign. Apart from this brief mention in the account of Uzziah's military exploits, no further details about Gurbaal are provided in the Bible.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Habor was a river located in Assyria, associated with the region of Gozan, where Israelite captives from the northern kingdom were settled by the Assyrians. During the reign of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser conquered Samaria and deported the Israelites to various locations in Assyria, including the cities of Halah and Habor, by the river Gozan (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11; 1 Chronicles 5:26). The practice of deporting conquered populations was a common strategy employed by the Assyrians to prevent rebellions and to integrate the conquered peoples into their empire. The exact location of the Habor River is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates River, located in modern-day Syria and Iraq. The Khabur River was known for its fertile lands and was an important region in the Assyrian Empire. The deportation of the Israelites to the region of the Habor River marked the end of the northern kingdom and the beginning of the Assyrian captivity, which had a profound impact on the history and identity of the Israelite people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hachilah was a hill located in the Wilderness of Ziph, in the region of Judah. It is mentioned in the context of David's flight from King Saul. The Ziphites, who inhabited the area, went to Saul at Gibeah and informed him that David was hiding in the strongholds at Hachilah (1 Samuel 23:19). Saul sought David in the Wilderness of Ziph and camped at Hachilah (1 Samuel 26:1, 3). David learned of Saul's presence and sent out spies to confirm his location. In a daring move, David and Abishai sneaked into Saul's camp at night and took Saul's spear and water jug, demonstrating that he could have killed Saul but chose to spare his life (1 Samuel 26:4-12). The hill of Hachilah served as a strategic hideout for David, providing him with a vantage point to monitor Saul's movements and evade capture. The exact location of Hachilah is not specified in the Bible, but it is described as being near the Wilderness of Ziph, which was located in the eastern part of the Judean wilderness.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hadad-rimmon was a place near Megiddo where a great lamentation was held for King Josiah, who was mortally wounded there.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hadad-rimmon is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Zechariah 12:11, as a place of mourning. The prophet compares the future mourning of Jerusalem to the weeping at Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. This is likely a reference to the lamentation over King Josiah, who was fatally wounded by Pharaoh Neco's archers at Megiddo (2 Chronicles 35:22-25). ¶The name Hadad-rimmon combines the names of two Semitic deities: Hadad, the storm god, and Rimmon, a god of thunder, suggesting the location may have had cultic significance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Rummaneh, a village in the Jezreel Valley about 6 miles south of Megiddo. ¶Zechariah's prophecy uses this historic event as a metaphor for the intense mourning that will take place when God pours out a spirit of grace and supplication on Jerusalem, causing them to look on the one they have pierced and mourn bitterly (Zechariah 12:10). The comparison emphasizes the depth and sincerity of the people's repentance.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hadid was a town located in the territory of Benjamin, mentioned in the context of the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. In the lists of the people who returned to Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, the men of Hadid are counted among the returnees (Ezra 2:33; Nehemiah 7:37). These lists suggest that Hadid was one of the towns resettled by the returning exiles as they reestablished their presence in the land. Hadid is also mentioned in the account of the resettlement of Jerusalem, where some of the people of Judah settled in Hadid and its surrounding villages (Nehemiah 11:34). The town's inclusion in this list indicates that it was part of the region surrounding Jerusalem and played a role in the reestablishment of Jewish communities after the exile. The exact location of Hadid is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be situated in the vicinity of Lod (Lydda) and Ono, towns located in the western part of Benjamin's territory, near the border with Judah.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hadrach is a place name that appears in a prophetic oracle in the book of Zechariah. In the oracle, the word of the Lord is described as being against the land of Hadrach and resting upon Damascus (Zechariah 9:1). The oracle goes on to pronounce judgment against various cities and regions, including Hamath, Tyre, and Sidon. The exact location and identity of Hadrach are uncertain, as it is not mentioned in any other biblical passages or in known extra-biblical sources from the time. Some scholars suggest that Hadrach may have been a region or city located in Syria, possibly in the vicinity of Damascus, based on the context of the prophetic oracle and the other places mentioned alongside it. However, this identification remains speculative due to the lack of corroborating evidence. The mention of Hadrach in Zechariah's prophecy suggests that it was a significant place in the geopolitical landscape of the time and that it was subject to God's judgment along with other nations and cities that opposed His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Halah was one of the places where the Assyrians settled the exiled Israelites after conquering the Northern Kingdom.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Halah was one of the locations where the Assyrians resettled the Israelites after the conquest of the Northern Kingdom (Israel) in 722 BC. It is mentioned three times in the Old Testament, always in the context of the Assyrian exile. ¶In 2 Kings 17:6, it is recorded that the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, settling them in Halah and other places. This event is also described in 2 Kings 18:11, emphasizing that the Israelites were deported because they had sinned against the Lord. ¶The third reference to Halah is in 1 Chronicles 5:26, which states that the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser III) and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, who took the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile, bringing them to Halah and other locations. ¶The exact location of Halah is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been in the region of the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia (modern-day Syria or Iraq). This area was under Assyrian control during the time of the Israelite exile. ¶The Bible does not provide any further information about Halah or the lives of the exiled Israelites there. However, the repeated mentions of Halah in the context of the Assyrian exile underscore the significance of this event in Israel's history and serve as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Halak was a mountain that served as a significant geographical marker in the accounts of Joshua's conquests in the Promised Land. It is mentioned twice in the book of Joshua as a reference point for the southern extent of the territory conquered by Joshua and the Israelites. In Joshua 11:17, Mount Halak is described as the mountain that goes up to Seir, marking the southern boundary of the land taken by Joshua, extending from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak. In Joshua 12:7, Mount Halak is again mentioned as the southern limit of the land that Joshua gave as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel. The exact location of Mount Halak is not specified in the Bible, but based on the geographical references, it is believed to be situated in the Negev region, possibly in the vicinity of the Ascent of Akrabbim and the border of Edom. Mount Halak's mention in the accounts of Joshua's conquests highlights the extent of the Israelites' victories and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land of Canaan.</ext_description>

It was located in the hill country of Judah, along with other towns such as Beth-zur, Gedor, and Beth-anoth (Joshua 15:58). The hill country of Judah was a region characterized by its rugged terrain and elevated landscape, situated between the Shephelah (lowlands) to the west and the Wilderness of Judah to the east. Apart from this single reference in the book of Joshua, no further information about Halhul is provided in the Bible. Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources. However, the inclusion of Halhul in the list of Judah's towns suggests that it was a settlement of some importance during the time of Joshua and the initial allocation of the land to the Israelite tribes.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Hall of Judgment was a hall in Solomon's palace where he sat to judge and administer justice (1 Kings 7:7).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Hall of Judgment was a significant room in King Solomon's palace complex. It was specifically designed and built for Solomon to sit and administer justice (1 Kings 7:7). The hall was constructed using cedar wood, with a cedar floor and cedar panels from floor to ceiling. It was part of the larger palace structure that Solomon built for himself, which also included the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Hall of Pillars, and his own living quarters. The Hall of Judgment served as a royal court where Solomon would hear cases, settle disputes, and deliver judgments. As the king of Israel, one of Solomon's primary responsibilities was to ensure justice and maintain order in the kingdom. The presence of a dedicated hall for judgment in his palace underscores the importance of this role and Solomon's commitment to wise governance. The Bible does not provide further details about the specific cases or decisions made in the Hall of Judgment, but it stands as a symbol of Solomon's wisdom and his role as a just ruler over Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Hall of Pillars, also known as the Porch of Pillars, was a structure built as part of King Solomon's palace complex in Jerusalem. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in 1 Kings 7:6, as part of the detailed description of Solomon's building projects. ¶According to the biblical account, the Hall of Pillars measured fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide (approximately 75 feet by 45 feet or 23 meters by 14 meters). It had a portico in front, likely supported by a row of pillars, and a canopy extending from the portico, possibly providing shade or shelter. ¶The specific purpose of this hall is not stated in the text. However, given its location within the palace complex and its impressive size, it may have served as a reception area, a place for public assemblies, or a venue for official ceremonies. ¶The Hall of Pillars was one of several structures mentioned in the description of Solomon's palace, which also included the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Hall of the Throne (or Hall of Judgment), and Solomon's personal residence (1 Kings 7:1-12). These buildings showcased the wealth, power, and architectural achievements of Solomon's reign. ¶The construction of the Hall of Pillars, along with the other palace structures and the Temple, demonstrated Solomon's commitment to establishing Jerusalem as a royal capital and a center of worship. The grandeur of these buildings testified to the prosperity and stability of the united monarchy under Solomon's rule.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Hall of the Throne was another name for the Hall of Judgment in Solomon's palace, where he sat to administer justice (1 Kings 7:7).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Hall of the Throne is mentioned in the description of King Solomon's palace complex and appears to be another name for the Hall of Judgment. In 1 Kings 7:7, it is stated that Solomon built the Hall of Judgment, where he was to judge, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling. The verse then refers to this hall as the &quot;Hall of the Throne,&quot; indicating that the two names refer to the same room. The throne mentioned here likely refers to the royal throne from which Solomon would sit and administer justice. As the king of Israel, Solomon's throne represented his authority and his role as the supreme judge in the land. The Hall of the Throne, therefore, served as the official space where Solomon exercised his judicial responsibilities and made decisions that impacted the lives of his subjects. The use of cedar paneling in the hall added to its grandeur and significance, reflecting the importance of the king's role and the solemnity of the proceedings that took place there. Beyond this brief mention in the description of Solomon's palace, no further details are provided about specific events or judgments that occurred in the Hall of the Throne.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ham is mentioned briefly in the account of the war of the kings in Genesis 14. During this conflict, Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allied kings waged war against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities in the region. In the course of their campaign, Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated several groups, including the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim (Genesis 14:5). The Zuzim, who were defeated in Ham, are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and little is known about them. Ham's exact location is also uncertain, as it is not referenced in any other biblical passages or extra-biblical sources. Its mention in the context of the war of the kings suggests that it was a place of some significance during the time of Abraham, but no further details about its history, size, or role in the region are provided. The defeat of the Zuzim in Ham by Chedorlaomer and his allies highlights the power and influence of these foreign kings in the region during this period. </ext_description>

		<short_description>Hamath, also known as Hamath Rabbah or Lebo-hamath, was a significant city and kingdom in Syria, frequently mentioned in the Bible as a reference point for the northern border of Israel and in the context of political and military events (Numbers 13:21; 34:8; Joshua 13:5; Judges 3:3; 2 Samuel 8:9; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Kings 14:25, 28; 17:24, 30; 18:34; 19:13; 23:33; 25:21; 1 Chronicles 13:5; 18:9; 2 Chronicles 7:8; 8:4; Isaiah 10:9; 11:11; 36:19; 37:13; Jeremiah 39:5; 49:23; 52:9, 27; Ezekiel 47:15-17, 20; 48:1; Amos 6:2, 14; Zechariah 9:2).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hamath, also referred to as Hamath Rabbah or Lebo-hamath, was a prominent city and kingdom located in Syria, north of Israel. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often serving as a reference point for the northern extent of Israel's territory (Numbers 13:21; 34:8; Joshua 13:5; Judges 3:3; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Chronicles 7:8; Ezekiel 47:15-17, 20; 48:1; Amos 6:14). ¶Hamath had its own kings, such as Toi, who sent his son Joram to congratulate David on his victories over Hadadezer (2 Samuel 8:9-10; 1 Chronicles 18:9-10). The city was known for its military strength and strategic importance, as evidenced by its mentions in the context of conflicts and conquests (2 Kings 14:28; 17:24, 30; 18:34; 19:13; Isaiah 10:9; 36:19; 37:13; Jeremiah 39:5; 49:23; 52:9, 27). ¶During the reigns of various Israelite kings, Hamath served as a marker of the extent of their dominion. Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (2 Kings 14:25). Solomon, known for his expansive kingdom, is described as having ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt, including Tiphsah and Gaza (1 Kings 4:21, 24). ¶The Assyrians conquered Hamath in the 8th century BC and deported some of its inhabitants to Samaria (2 Kings 17:24, 30). The fall of Hamath is mentioned in the prophetic oracles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, often in the context of judgment against the city for its pride and wickedness (Isaiah 10:9; Jeremiah 49:23; Amos 6:2). ¶In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, Hamath is mentioned as one of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:15-17, 20; 48:1), indicating its continued significance as a geographical marker. ¶The exact location of Hamath is believed to be near the modern-day city of Hama in western Syria, situated along the Orontes River. Its strategic location along trade routes and its proximity to Israel made it a city of great importance in the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hammath, also referred to as Hammoth-dor or Hammon, was a city located in the territory of Naphtali, one of the northern tribes of Israel. It is mentioned in the book of Joshua as one of the fortified cities in Naphtali (Joshua 19:35) and as a city given to the Levites from the tribe of Naphtali (Joshua 21:32; 1 Chronicles 6:76). The Levites were the priestly tribe of Israel, and they were allocated cities throughout the land to fulfill their religious duties and serve the people. ¶The exact location of Hammath is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be situated in the Upper Galilee region, near the Sea of Galilee. Some scholars identify it with the modern-day site of Hammat Tiberias, known for its hot springs, located south of Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. ¶Apart from its mention in the lists of cities and Levitical towns, no further details about Hammath's history, size, or significance are provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in these lists, however, indicates that it was a city of some importance during the time of the Israelite settlement in the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hamonah is a city mentioned in Ezekiel's vision (Ezekiel 39:16), its name meaning &quot;multitude&quot; or &quot;horde,&quot; likely referring to the burial place of Gog's army.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hamonah is a city mentioned in the prophetic vision of Ezekiel, specifically in Ezekiel 39:16. The name &quot;Hamonah&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;hamon,&quot; meaning &quot;multitude&quot; or &quot;horde.&quot; ¶In the context of Ezekiel's prophecy, Hamonah is associated with the aftermath of the battle against Gog and his armies. The preceding verses describe how God will strike down Gog and his hordes on the mountains of Israel, leaving their bodies to be consumed by birds and beasts (Ezekiel 39:1-4). ¶The slain army of Gog will be so numerous that it will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury them and cleanse the land (Ezekiel 39:12-14). The place where Gog's multitude is buried will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog, meaning &quot;the multitude of Gog&quot; (Ezekiel 39:11). ¶After this burial, the city nearby will be renamed Hamonah (Ezekiel 39:16). The renaming of the city to &quot;Multitude&quot; or &quot;Horde&quot; serves as a lasting reminder of the immense number of Gog's soldiers who were defeated and buried there. ¶The exact location of Hamonah is not specified in the text, and there is no historical record of a city by this name. As Ezekiel's prophecy is highly symbolic and apocalyptic, the city of Hamonah may not refer to a literal, physical city but rather serves as a metaphor for the complete destruction and burial of God's enemies. ¶The prophecy of Hamonah and the defeat of Gog underscores God's ultimate victory over the forces of evil and His protection of His people, Israel. It also emphasizes the importance of cleansing the land from the defilement caused by sin and God's enemies.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Valley of Hamon-gog is the place where Gog and his army will be buried after their defeat, as prophesied by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 39:11, 15).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Valley of Hamon-gog is a prophetic location mentioned in the book of Ezekiel. In Ezekiel's vision, Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, leads a great army against Israel in the latter days. However, God intervenes and defeats Gog and his army, causing them to fall upon the mountains of Israel (Ezekiel 38-39). ¶After this decisive battle, the Valley of Hamon-gog is designated as the burial place for Gog and his hordes (Ezekiel 39:11). The name &quot;Hamon-gog&quot; means &quot;the multitude of Gog,&quot; reflecting the vast number of soldiers in Gog's army. The valley is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea, and it will be a place of renown, known for the mass burial of Gog's defeated forces. ¶The prophecy also mentions that the people of Israel will be burying the remains of Gog's army for seven months to cleanse the land (Ezekiel 39:12-16). The valley will be renamed the &quot;Valley of Hamon-gog&quot; as a reminder of God's judgment upon Gog and his forces. ¶The exact location of the Valley of Hamon-gog is not specified in the Bible, as it is a prophetic place associated with future events. The prophecy of Gog and Magog's defeat and the subsequent burial in the Valley of Hamon-gog serves as a powerful message of God's sovereignty and protection over His people, Israel, in the face of overwhelming adversity.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hanes is an Egyptian city mentioned briefly in the book of Isaiah. In a prophecy concerning Judah's futile reliance on Egypt for protection against the Assyrian threat, Isaiah declares that Judah's princes were at Zoan, and their envoys had arrived at Hanes (Isaiah 30:4). ¶The exact location of Hanes is uncertain, but it is believed to be situated in ancient Egypt, possibly in the Nile Delta region. Some scholars identify it with the city of Heracleopolis Magna, known as &quot;Hnen-nesut&quot; in ancient Egyptian texts, which was located near the entrance of the Faiyum region. ¶Isaiah's prophecy condemns Judah's political alliance with Egypt, portraying it as a useless and shameful endeavor. The mention of Hanes, along with Zoan (Tanis), another Egyptian city, highlights the extent of Judah's diplomatic efforts to secure Egypt's support against the impending Assyrian invasion. ¶Apart from this single reference in Isaiah, Hanes is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Its inclusion in the prophecy serves to underscore the futility of Judah's reliance on human alliances, particularly with Egypt, instead of trusting in God for protection and deliverance.</ext_description>

In the description of Zebulun's boundaries, Hannathon is mentioned as one of the towns marking the eastern border of their territory (Joshua 19:14). ¶The exact location of Hannathon is not specified in the Bible, but based on the description of Zebulun's borders, it is believed to have been situated in the lower Galilee region, likely near the Kishon River. The town's name, Hannathon, is of Hebrew origin and means &quot;favored&quot; or &quot;gracious.&quot; ¶Apart from its mention in the delineation of Zebulun's territory, no further information about Hannathon is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The tribe of Zebulun, along with the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali, occupied the fertile lands of the Galilee region. They were known for their agricultural and commercial activities, benefiting from the region's rich soil and proximity to trade routes.</ext_description>

The deportation of these Israelite tribes to Hara and other locations was part of the Assyrian policy of resettling conquered populations to prevent rebellions and to integrate them into the empire.</ext_description>

It is listed in Numbers 33:24-25, which records the stages of Israel's journey in the wilderness. ¶According to the text, the Israelites set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. From there, they moved on and camped at Terah. Then they set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah. The next stop after Mithkah was Hashmonah, followed by Moseroth, Bene-jaakan, Hor-haggidgad, and Jotbathah. After Jotbathah, they camped at Abronah, and then at Ezion-geber. Finally, they set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. It was after leaving Kadesh that they camped at Mount Hor, and then at Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, and Iye-abarim. The next stop mentioned after Iye-abarim is Dibon-gad, followed by Almon-diblathaim, and then the mountains of Abarim before Nebo. ¶In this context, Haradah is listed between Hashmonah and Makheloth in the sequence of campsites.  ¶The mention of Haradah in the itinerary of Israel's wilderness journey serves to emphasize God's guidance and provision for His people during their 40-year sojourn in the desert. It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Haran, also known as Charan, was a significant city in Mesopotamia, located in modern-day Turkey. It played a crucial role in the life of Abraham and his family. After leaving Ur of the Chaldeans, Abraham, his father Terah, and his nephew Lot settled in Haran (Genesis 11:31). It was in Haran that Terah died (Genesis 11:32), and from there, Abraham departed for Canaan in response to God's call (Genesis 12:4-5). Later, when Jacob fled from his brother Esau, he sought refuge in Haran with his uncle Laban (Genesis 27:43; 28:10). Jacob lived in Haran for many years, marrying Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel, and working for Laban (Genesis 29:4). Haran was known for its association with the worship of the moon god, Sin. In the Old Testament, Haran is mentioned as one of the places conquered by the Assyrian kings (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12) and as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23). The city's strategic location along major trade routes contributed to its importance in the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

In Amos 4:3, the prophet declares judgment upon the wealthy women of Samaria, saying, &quot;You will go out through broken walls, each one straight ahead of her, and you will be cast out toward Harmon.&quot; The exact location and meaning of Harmon are uncertain, as the name is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other ancient Near Eastern sources. Some scholars suggest that Harmon may refer to a place of exile or captivity, possibly in Assyria or Armenia, where the Israelites would be taken as a result of God's judgment. Others propose that it could be a symbolic name representing the fate of the exiled Israelites. The context of the passage suggests that Harmon is a place of punishment and humiliation for the proud and oppressive women of Samaria, who would be driven out of their city and cast into a foreign land. Amos's prophecy serves as a warning against the social injustice and religious unfaithfulness that characterized Israel during his time.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Harod, also known as the Spring of Harod or the Well of Harod, was a significant water source mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the story of Gideon. In Judges 7:1, it is recorded that Gideon and his army camped beside the spring of Harod, while the Midianites were north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. It was at this location that God instructed Gideon to reduce his army from 32,000 men to a mere 300, based on how they drank water from the spring (Judges 7:4-7). This event demonstrated God's power to deliver Israel from their enemies, even with a small force. The exact location of the Spring of Harod is not certain, but it is believed to be in the Jezreel Valley, near the ancient city of Jezreel. The spring is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men, Shammah the Harodite (2 Samuel 23:25) and Elika the Harodite (1 Chronicles 11:27), indicating that it may have been a place of origin or residence for some of David's warriors. The Spring of Harod played a crucial role in Gideon's victory over the Midianites and serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power to deliver His people.</ext_description>

It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership. ¶As with many of the places mentioned in the wilderness itinerary, Hashmonah's significance lies primarily in its role as a marker in Israel's divinely-led journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. Its inclusion in the biblical record underscores the historical and theological importance of this formative period in Israel's history.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hauran was a fertile region located east of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned as part of Israel's future boundaries (Ezek 47:16,18).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hauran was a region situated east of the Sea of Galilee, known for its fertile lands. The prophet Ezekiel, in his vision of the restored land of Israel, described Hauran as part of the eastern border, between the territories of Damascus and Gilead (Ezek 47:16,18). This area was known for its rich basaltic soil, which supported productive agriculture. In the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Hauran was part of the Decapolis and later the province of Arabia Petraea. Today, Hauran is a region primarily located in southwestern Syria and parts of northern Jordan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Havilah was a region located in the northwestern Arabian Peninsula, inhabited by the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son (Gen 25:18). The Ishmaelites settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, which bordered Egypt to the east. During King Saul's reign, he launched a military campaign against the Amalekites, a nomadic people who lived in the region. Saul's army attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur (1 Sam 15:7), indicating that Havilah marked the eastern extent of the Amalekite territory. This Havilah is distinct from the one mentioned in the Garden of Eden account and is likely located in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hazar-addar was a town located on the southern border of Canaan, as described in the book of Numbers. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Numbers 34:4, as part of the delineation of the southern boundary of the Promised Land. ¶In the context of Numbers 34, God is giving Moses instructions about the boundaries of the land that the Israelites are to inherit. The southern border is described as running from the end of the Salt Sea (the Dead Sea) southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passing along to Zin, and going south of Kadesh-barnea before proceeding to Hazar-addar and continuing to Azmon. ¶The exact location of Hazar-addar is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement in the region during the time of Moses. ¶As part of the southern border, Hazar-addar would have been situated in the arid wilderness region of the Negev, south of Canaan. The name &quot;Hazar&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word for &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;settlement,&quot; indicating that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment along the desert route. ¶The mention of Hazar-addar in the biblical text serves to define the extent of the Promised Land and to underscore God's specific instructions to Moses regarding the territory that the Israelites were to possess. Its inclusion in the boundary description also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the transmission of God's commands.</ext_description>

The name &quot;Hazar-susim&quot; means &quot;village of horses&quot; in Hebrew, suggesting that the town may have been known for its horse-breeding or horse-related activities. ¶The town is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of a list of cities and villages belonging to the tribe of Simeon. This list is part of a genealogical record of the descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. ¶According to the text, the Simeonites had their inheritance within the territory of Judah, as the land allocated to Judah was too large for them (Joshua 19:9). The list in 1 Chronicles 4 enumerates the towns and villages that were part of Simeon's inheritance. ¶Hazar-susim is listed along with other towns such as Bethul, Hormah, Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-shual. These settlements were located in the Negev region, the southern part of Canaan, known for its arid and semi-arid climate. ¶The exact location of Hazar-susim is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. However, its inclusion in the list of Simeonite towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement within their territory during the time of the chronicler. ¶The mention of Hazar-susim in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allocated to the tribe of Simeon and to underscore the importance of maintaining accurate genealogical records. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hazeroth was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness wanderings after leaving Mount Sinai. It is mentioned several times in the book of Numbers and once in Deuteronomy (Num 11:35; 12:16; 33:17-18; Deut 1:1). The name &quot;Hazeroth&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;hatser,&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;court,&quot; suggesting that the site may have had some form of semi-permanent structures. At Hazeroth, Moses faced challenges to his leadership from his siblings, Aaron and Miriam (Num 12). God affirmed Moses' unique role as His chosen leader and judged Miriam with temporary leprosy. The Israelites remained at Hazeroth for an unspecified period before setting out into the wilderness of Paran (Num 12:16). The exact location of Hazeroth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula, between Mount Sinai and Kadesh-barnea.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hazor refers to a region in Arabia, possibly Ituraea, against which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, launched a military campaign (Jer 49:28,30,33).</short_description>
		<ext_description>In Jeremiah 49:28,30,33, Hazor refers to a region in Arabia, possibly Ituraea, which was threatened by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. The prophecy in Jeremiah 49 describes the impending judgment against various nations, including Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor. The inhabitants of Hazor are urged to flee and dwell in the depths of the wilderness to escape the coming destruction (Jer 49:30). This Hazor is not related to the Canaanite city or the towns mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hazor was a town allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hazor was a town located in the Negev region, the southern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 15:23, as part of the list of towns and villages in the southland of Judah. ¶In the context of Joshua 15, the chapter describes the boundaries and cities of Judah's inheritance in the Promised Land. The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. ¶Hazor is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Kedesh, Ithnan, Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth. The exact location of this Hazor is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. ¶The name &quot;Hazor&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;settlement,&quot; suggesting that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment in the region. ¶The mention of Hazor in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hazor was the largest and most important city in Canaan during the time of Joshua, serving as the head of the northern Canaanite kingdoms (Josh 11:10). Its king, Jabin, led a coalition against Israel, but was defeated by Joshua, who captured and destroyed Hazor (Josh 11:1,10-11,13). The city was allotted to the tribe of Naphtali (Josh 19:36). Hazor later revived and oppressed Israel, but was defeated by Deborah and Barak (Judg 4:2,17). The city was fortified by Solomon (1 Kgs 9:15) and was one of the first cities captured by Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria during his invasion of Israel (2 Kgs 15:29). Excavations at Tel Hazor have revealed a large, heavily fortified city with Canaanite temples and palaces, as well as evidence of destruction by fire, possibly corroborating the biblical account of Joshua's conquest.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hebron, also known as Kiriath-arba, was a significant city in Judah, associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and later became a Levitical city and a city of refuge.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hebron, also known as Kiriath-arba, was an important city located in the hill country of Judah. It is first mentioned in Genesis 13:18, where Abraham pitched his tent and built an altar to the Lord. The city was originally named Kiriath-arba, which means &quot;the city of Arba,&quot; who was the greatest man among the Anakim (Joshua 14:15). ¶Hebron played a significant role in the lives of the patriarchs. Sarah, Abraham's wife, died in Kiriath-arba, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for her (Genesis 23:2, 19). Later, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were also buried there (Genesis 35:27; 49:29-32). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Hebron was taken by Joshua and the Israelites (Joshua 10:36-37). The city was given to Caleb as his inheritance (Joshua 14:13-14), and later became a city of the Levites and a city of refuge (Joshua 20:7; 21:11-13). ¶Hebron served as the capital of Judah during the reign of David. He was anointed king over the house of Judah in Hebron and reigned there for seven and a half years (2 Samuel 2:1-4, 11; 5:5). Several of David's sons were born in Hebron, including Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah (2 Samuel 3:2-5). ¶The city remained significant throughout Israel's history. It was fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:10) and was inhabited by Jews after the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). ¶Hebron is also notable for its association with the Anakim, a group of giants who inhabited the area (Numbers 13:22, 33). Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai (Joshua 15:13-14; Judges 1:10, 20). ¶Today, Hebron is still an important city, known for the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is believed to be the burial site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The city has a rich history and holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.</ext_description>

The Hebron Valley was likely in the vicinity of Hebron, a city located in the hill country of Judah, approximately 19 miles south of Jerusalem. The fact that Joseph traveled from the Hebron Valley to Shechem, a distance of about 50 miles, demonstrates the significant distance he had to cover to find his brothers.</ext_description>

It was particularly noted for its fine wine, which was highly prized and traded in the region. The exact location of Helbon is not certain, but it is believed to be modern-day Halbun, a village located about 11 miles north of Damascus, Syria. This identification is supported by the fact that the area around Halbun is still known for producing high-quality grapes and wine. Some scholars have suggested that Helbon might be the same as Aleppo (Haleb), but this is less likely given the distance between Aleppo and Damascus.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Helech was either a place, possibly in Cilicia, or a term referring to the army of Tyre, mentioned in Ezekiel's prophecy against Tyre.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Helech is a term that appears only once in the Bible, in Ezekiel 27:11, as part of a prophecy against the city of Tyre. The exact meaning and identity of Helech is uncertain, and Bible scholars have proposed different interpretations. ¶One view is that Helech refers to a place, possibly the Assyrian name for the region of Cilicia, located north of the Taurus Mountains. The Cilicians were known for their warlike character and could have served as mercenaries in the army of Tyre, which would fit the context of Ezekiel's prophecy. ¶Another interpretation is that Helech is not a place name but rather a Hebrew term derived from the root word חיל (ḥayil), meaning &quot;strength&quot; or &quot;army.&quot; In this case, the final letter of Helech would be understood as a feminine form of the pronoun &quot;you,&quot; referring to the city of Tyre. This interpretation is supported by the King James Version and the American Standard Version, which translate Helech as &quot;thine army.&quot; ¶The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, seems to favor the interpretation of Helech as a term for Tyre's army rather than a place name. ¶Given the limited information provided in the single biblical reference, the exact identity of Helech remains uncertain. The mention of Helech in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to emphasize the strength and military might of Tyre, which would ultimately be brought to ruin by God's judgment, as declared by the prophet Ezekiel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Helkath, also known as Hukok, was a city located within the territory allocated to the tribe of Asher (Josh 19:25). It was later designated as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Gershon (Josh 21:31; 1 Chr 6:75). The Levites were not given a specific territory but were distributed among the other tribes to serve as priests and teachers. The allocation of cities like Helkath ensured that the Levites had places to live and carry out their duties. The exact location of Helkath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the western part of Galilee, within the region assigned to Asher.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Helkath-hazzurim, meaning &quot;Field of Swords&quot; or &quot;Field of Hostilities,&quot; was the name given to a site where a battle took place between the men of David and those of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul (2 Sam 2:16). After Saul's death, Ish-bosheth was proclaimed king over Israel, while David was anointed as king over Judah. The battle at Helkath-hazzurim was part of the ongoing conflict between the two factions. Twelve men from each side were chosen to fight in hand-to-hand combat, and they killed each other simultaneously. This led to a fierce battle in which David's men, under the leadership of Joab, defeated Abner and the men of Israel. The exact location of Helkath-hazzurim is not specified, but it was likely near Gibeon, where the two armies initially confronted each other (2 Sam 2:13).</ext_description>

The Assyrian conquest of Hena is mentioned in the context of Sennacherib's boasting about the cities and kingdoms that had fallen to Assyria, challenging Hezekiah's faith in God's ability to protect Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Hepher was a Canaanite city conquered by Joshua and later became part of a district under Solomon's rule.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Hepher was a Canaanite city mentioned in the Old Testament. It first appears in Joshua 12:17 as one of the cities conquered by Joshua and the Israelites during their campaign to take possession of the Promised Land. The city was ruled by a king, who was defeated along with other Canaanite rulers. ¶The exact location of Hepher is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, as it is listed among other cities in that region, such as Tappuah and Aphek. ¶Hepher is mentioned again in 1 Kings 4:10, where it is described as part of a district under Solomon's rule. The passage lists the twelve officers who were appointed to provide food for King Solomon and his household, each responsible for a specific region. The district that included Hepher was overseen by the son of Hesed. ¶The fact that Hepher was a city with its own king during the time of Joshua and later became part of a district under Solomon's rule suggests that it was a place of some significance. However, the Bible does not provide any further details about the city's history, size, or importance. ¶The mention of Hepher in the biblical text serves to highlight the extent of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership and the later organization of the kingdom under Solomon's reign. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites as an inheritance.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Hermon, located on the northern border of Israel, is the highest peak in the Anti-Lebanon mountain range. It is also referred to by various names, including Baal-hermon, Baal-hamon, Baal-gad, Senir, and Sirion (Deut 3:8-9; 4:48; Josh 11:3,17; 12:1,5,7; 13:5,11; 1 Chr 5:23; Ps 29:6; 42:6; 89:12; 133:3; Song 4:8; 8:11; Jer 18:14; Ezek 27:5). The mountain marked the northern extent of the Promised Land conquered by Joshua (Josh 11:17; 12:1,5). It was also the northern limit of the territory allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Josh 13:11; 1 Chr 5:23). The Sidonians called the mountain Sirion, while the Amorites called it Senir (Deut 3:9; Ezek 27:5). Mount Hermon was known for its abundant dew (Ps 133:3) and was a source of refreshment for the surrounding lands (Jer 18:14). The mountain was also associated with the Canaanite god Baal, as evidenced by the names Baal-hermon, Baal-hamon, and Baal-gad (Judg 3:3; Song 8:11). Its majestic appearance is celebrated in the Psalms (Ps 29:6; 89:12), and it is mentioned as a place of beauty and fertility (Song 4:8).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Heshbon, an Amorite city conquered by Moses (Num 21:25-30), was allotted to Reuben (Num 32:37; Josh 13:17) but later given to the Levites (Josh 21:39); it was a significant city in the region (Isa 15:4; 16:8-9; Jer 48:2, 34, 45; 49:3).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Heshbon was a prominent Amorite city located about 50 miles east of Jerusalem, in what is now western Jordan. It was the capital of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had taken it from the Moabites (Num 21:26-30). During the Israelites' journey to Canaan, Moses conquered Heshbon and its surrounding territories (Num 21:25, 34; Deut 1:4; 2:24-30; 3:2, 6; 4:46; 29:7). The city was initially allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Num 32:3, 37; Josh 13:10, 17) but was later given to the tribe of Gad (Josh 13:26) and then to the Levites (Josh 21:39; 1 Chr 6:81). Heshbon was a significant city in the region, mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible (Josh 9:10; 12:2, 5; Judg 11:19, 26; Neh 9:22; Song 7:4; Isa 15:4; 16:8-9; Jer 48:2, 34, 45; 49:3). Its ruins, known as Hesban, have been excavated by archaeologists, revealing its rich history from biblical times through the Byzantine period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Heshmon was a town allotted to the tribe of Judah in the Negev region.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Heshmon was a town located in the Negev region, the southern part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 15:27, as part of the list of towns and villages in the southland of Judah. ¶In the context of Joshua 15, the chapter describes the boundaries and cities of Judah's inheritance in the Promised Land. The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. ¶Heshmon is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Moladah, Hazar-gaddah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. The exact location of Heshmon is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. ¶The name &quot;Heshmon&quot; is derived from the Hebrew root meaning &quot;fatness&quot; or &quot;fertility,&quot; which may suggest that the town was situated in a relatively fertile area within the Negev region, known for its arid climate. ¶The mention of Heshmon in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.</ext_description>

In Ezekiel's vision, the northern border extends from the Mediterranean Sea to Hethlon and then continues eastward toward Hamath and Zedad. The exact location of Hethlon is uncertain, but it was likely a significant landmark or settlement in the region of Lebo-hamath, which is associated with the entrance to Hamath, a city in modern-day Syria. Hethlon's mention in Ezekiel's vision emphasizes the extent and boundaries of the ideal, restored land of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Hierapolis was an ancient city located in the region of Phrygia, in modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned once in the New Testament, in Paul's letter to the Colossians (Col 4:13). In this passage, Paul expresses his concern for the believers in Hierapolis, along with those in Laodicea and Colossae. This suggests that there was a Christian community in Hierapolis during the first century AD. Hierapolis was known for its hot springs and became a popular spa city in the Roman period. The city was also associated with the worship of the Phrygian mother goddess Cybele. The ruins of Hierapolis, including well-preserved Roman baths, temples, and a necropolis, can still be seen today.</ext_description>

After rescuing his nephew Lot, who had been taken captive by Chedorlaomer and his allies, Abraham chased them as far as Hobah. The exact location of Hobah is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the vicinity of modern-day Choba, about 60 miles north of Damascus. Some Jewish traditions identify Hobah with the village of Jobar, near Damascus, where there is a synagogue dedicated to Elijah. The name &quot;Hobah&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;hiding place&quot; or the Akkadian word meaning &quot;land of reeds.&quot;</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Holy Place refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle and later the Temple, where the priests performed their duties. It was separated from the outer court by a veil (Exodus 26:33). The Holy Place contained the lampstand, the table of showbread, and the altar of incense (Exodus 31:8; 35:19; 39:1). Only consecrated priests could enter the Holy Place (Exodus 28:29,43; 29:30). Rituals performed there included burning incense and presenting offerings (Leviticus 6:30; Numbers 28:7). The Holy Place represented God's presence among His people, though access was restricted. In the New Testament, Christ's sacrifice opened the way for believers to enter God's presence (Hebrews 9:12; 10:19).</ext_description>

During Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan, God commanded Moses to take Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of Mount Hor. There, Moses removed Aaron's priestly garments and put them on Eleazar, transferring the high priesthood to him. Aaron died on the mountain and was mourned by the Israelites for 30 days (Numbers 20:25-29). The people then traveled from Mount Hor to the Red Sea to bypass Edom (Numbers 21:4). Mount Hor marked the end of Aaron's leadership as high priest and his death in the 40th year after the Exodus (Numbers 33:38-39).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Horonaim, a Moabite city featured in prophecies against Moab.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Horonaim was a city in Moab that is mentioned in the context of prophetic judgments against Moab (Isaiah 15:5; Jeremiah 48:3, 5, 34). The name Horonaim means &quot;two caves&quot; or &quot;double cave.&quot; In Isaiah's oracle, the people of Moab are described as fleeing to Zoar and Horonaim, crying out in distress. Jeremiah's prophecy portrays the impending destruction of Moab, with the sound of crying from Horonaim and the anguish of its inhabitants. These prophecies indicate that Horonaim was a significant city in Moab, but its exact location is unknown.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Horse Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:28). It was located in the eastern part of the city, near the temple area. The gate's name suggests that it may have been used for horses to enter and exit the city, possibly in connection with the king's stables. In Nehemiah's account of rebuilding the wall, the priests made repairs to the wall near the Horse Gate, indicating its proximity to the temple. The Horse Gate is also mentioned in Jeremiah 31:40 as a landmark describing the future expansion and consecration of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Iconium was a city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) that was visited by the apostle Paul during his missionary journeys. After being forced to leave Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Barnabas went to Iconium, where they preached in the synagogue and many Jews and Gentiles believed (Acts 13:51; 14:1). However, the unbelieving Jews stirred up opposition, and Paul and Barnabas had to flee to Lystra and Derbe (Acts 14:19, 21). Later, Paul revisited Iconium to strengthen the disciples (Acts 16:2). In his letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions he endured in Iconium (2 Timothy 3:11). Iconium was located in the region of Lycaonia and was an important city in the Roman province of Galatia. Today, it is known as Konya, Turkey.</ext_description>

		<short_description>India, the eastern extent of Ahasuerus' Persian Empire (Esther 1:1; 8:9).</short_description>
		<ext_description>India is mentioned twice in the book of Esther as the eastern boundary of the Persian Empire during the reign of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I). In Esther 1:1, the vast extent of Ahasuerus' kingdom is described, stretching from India to Ethiopia (Cush). Later, in Esther 8:9, when the king issues a decree to protect the Jews, it is sent to all the provinces from India to Ethiopia. These references suggest that the Persian Empire had control over or influence in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. However, the Bible does not provide any specific details about the region or its people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Italy is mentioned several times in the New Testament as a region in southern Europe, home to the Roman Empire. In Acts 18:2, we learn that Aquila, a Jew from Pontus, had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla due to the emperor Claudius' decree expelling all Jews from Rome. In Acts 27:1, 6, Paul embarks on his journey to Rome, sailing on ships from Alexandria and Adramyttium that were bound for Italy. The author of Hebrews also mentions Italy, sending greetings from those who had come from there (Hebrews 13:24). Additionally, Acts 10:1 mentions the Italian Regiment, a Roman military unit stationed in Caesarea. These references highlight the significant role Italy played in the early spread of Christianity and its connection to the Roman Empire.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Jabbok is a river located east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead. It is first mentioned in the Bible when Jacob crossed it on his way back to Canaan after his time with Laban (Genesis 32:22). It was at the Jabbok that Jacob wrestled with God and was given the name Israel (Genesis 32:24-30). The Jabbok served as a boundary between the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan (Numbers 21:24; Deuteronomy 2:37; 3:16; Joshua 12:2). During the time of the judges, the Ammonites accused Israel of taking their land between the Arnon and the Jabbok (Judges 11:13, 22). The Jabbok River flows westward into the Jordan River and is known today as the Zarqa River in Jordan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Jabesh-gilead, a town in Gilead known for its loyalty to King Saul.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jabesh, also known as Jabesh-gilead, was a town located in the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. The city is first mentioned in the book of Judges, where the inhabitants refused to join the Israelites in fighting against the tribe of Benjamin (Judges 21:8-14). As a result, the town was attacked, and the virgins of Jabesh were given as wives to the surviving Benjamites. Later, during the reign of King Saul, the Ammonites besieged Jabesh, and Saul came to their rescue, defeating the Ammonites and solidifying his position as king (1 Samuel 11:1-11). After Saul's death, the men of Jabesh bravely retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the Philistines and buried them (1 Samuel 31:11-13; 1 Chronicles 10:11-12). David later praised the men of Jabesh for their loyalty and kindness to Saul (2 Samuel 2:4-7). The town's location is uncertain, but it was likely situated in northern Gilead, possibly near modern-day Wadi Yabis in Jordan.</ext_description>

It was conquered by the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land (Numbers 21:32) and later allotted to the tribe of Gad (Numbers 32:1,3,35; Joshua 13:25). The town and its surrounding villages were known for their fertile land, particularly suitable for livestock (Numbers 32:1). Jazer was also designated as a Levitical city (Joshua 21:39; 1 Chronicles 6:81) and served as a location for the Hebronites, a Levite family, to pasture their flocks (1 Chronicles 26:31). The city was famous for its vineyards, which are mentioned in the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah (Isaiah 16:8,9; Jeremiah 48:32). During the reign of David, Jazer marked the starting point for the census of Israel (2 Samuel 24:5).

		<short_description>The Sea of Jazer, a poetic reference to the abundant vineyards of Jazer (Jeremiah 48:32).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Jazer Sea is a poetic expression used by the prophet Jeremiah in his lament over Moab (Jeremiah 48:32). In this passage, Jeremiah mourns the destruction of Moab and its renowned vineyards, particularly those of Jazer. The phrase &quot;Sea of Jazer&quot; is a metaphorical reference to the abundance and fertility of the vineyards in the region of Jazer. It emphasizes the extent and significance of the vineyards, comparing them to a vast sea. This poetic language highlights the devastating impact of the destruction of these vineyards on the people of Moab and the region's economy.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Jericho, an ancient Canaanite city famously conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jericho, also known as the &quot;City of Palms,&quot; was a prominent city in the Jordan Valley near the Jordan River. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with archaeological evidence dating back to 9000 BC. In the Bible, Jericho is most famous as the first city conquered by the Israelites after they crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land (Joshua 2-6). The city's walls miraculously fell after the Israelites marched around it for seven days, allowing them to destroy the city. Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:21) and was later rebuilt during the time of Ahab (1 Kings 16:34). The city also played a role in several other biblical events, such as being the location where the Israelites camped before entering Canaan (Numbers 22:1; 26:3, 63), where Eglon, king of Moab, oppressed Israel (Judges 3:12-14), and where Zedekiah was captured by the Babylonians (Jeremiah 39:5; 52:8). In the New Testament, Jericho is mentioned as the place where Jesus healed blind Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46) and where he encountered Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Jericho Valley, also known as the Jordan Valley or the Plain of Jericho, is the area surrounding the city of Jericho. It is mentioned in Deuteronomy 34:3 as part of the land shown to Moses by God before his death on Mount Nebo. The valley is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, north of the Dead Sea and west of the Jordan River. It is known for its fertile soil and warm climate, which allows for the cultivation of various crops, including dates and other fruits. The Jericho Valley's strategic location made it an important trade route and a key entry point into Canaan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Jerusalem, the capital of Israel and a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jerusalem is one of the most important cities in the Bible, serving as the capital of Israel and a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is mentioned hundreds of times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The city was originally known as Salem (Genesis 14:18; Psalm 76:2) and was later called Jebus, after the Jebusites who inhabited it (Judges 19:10; 1 Chronicles 11:4). David conquered the city and made it his capital (2 Samuel 5:6-9; 1 Chronicles 11:4-9). Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6-8; 2 Chronicles 3-7), which became the center of Jewish worship. The city was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10; 2 Chronicles 36:17-19) but was later rebuilt after the exile (Ezra 1:1-4; Nehemiah 2:11-20). In the New Testament, Jerusalem is the site of many events in the life of Jesus, including his triumphal entry (Matthew 21:1-11), cleansing of the temple (Matthew 21:12-17), and crucifixion (Matthew 27:32-56). The early church also began in Jerusalem (Acts 1-7). Throughout the Bible, Jerusalem is referred to by various names, each highlighting a different aspect of its significance: Ariel (Isaiah 29:1), My Delight Is in Her (Isaiah 62:4), Forsaken and Desolate (Isaiah 62:4), Married (Isaiah 62:4), the City of the Lord (Isaiah 60:14), Zion (Psalm 87:2), and Mount Zion (Psalm 48:1). The name &quot;Jerusalem&quot; itself may mean &quot;foundation of peace&quot; or &quot;possession of peace.&quot;</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Jeshanah was a town that was captured by King Abijah of Judah during his war against Jeroboam, king of Israel (2 Chronicles 13:19). The town was taken along with Bethel and Ephron, indicating that it was likely located in the northern part of Judah, near the border with Israel. No further information about Jeshanah is provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. The capture of Jeshanah, along with the other towns, was a significant victory for Abijah and demonstrated God's support for the king of Judah in the conflict against Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Jeshimon is a wilderness area mentioned in the Bible, located near the town of Ziph in the Judean Desert. It is described as a place where David sought refuge from King Saul, who was pursuing him. The Ziphites, inhabitants of Ziph, informed Saul about David's hiding place in the strongholds of Jeshimon (1 Samuel 23:19). Saul searched for David in the wilderness of Ziph and Jeshimon (1 Samuel 23:24), and later camped in Jeshimon when pursuing David (1 Samuel 26:1, 3). The exact location of Jeshimon is not certain, but it is believed to be in the eastern part of the Judean Desert, near the Dead Sea.</ext_description>

Later in the narrative, he is referred to as Merib-baal (also known as Mephibosheth), and David shows kindness to him for the sake of his father Jonathan (2 Samuel 9). </ext_description>

		<short_description>Jezreel, a town in Judah, home of Ahinoam, one of David's wives (Joshua 15:56; 1 Samuel 25:43).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jezreel was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:56). It is primarily mentioned in connection with Ahinoam, one of David's wives, who was from Jezreel (1 Samuel 25:43). Ahinoam was with David during his time in Ziklag, where he sought refuge from King Saul (1 Samuel 27:3). She was also one of the two wives taken captive by the Amalekites when they raided Ziklag, but David pursued the raiders and rescued her (1 Samuel 30:5). After Saul's death, Ahinoam went with David to Hebron, where he was anointed king over Judah (2 Samuel 2:2). She bore David's firstborn son, Amnon, in Hebron (2 Samuel 3:2). This Jezreel should not be confused with the more prominent city of Jezreel in the Jezreel Valley, associated with the kings of Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Jezreel, a city in Issachar, known for its association with King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jezreel was a prominent city in the Jezreel Valley, located in the territory of Issachar (Joshua 19:18). It served as one of the royal residences of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel (1 Kings 21:1). The city is best known for its association with the vineyard of Naboth, which Ahab coveted and acquired through Jezebel's scheming, leading to the prophecy of their downfall (1 Kings 21). Jezreel was also the scene of Jehu's coup against the house of Ahab, where he killed Joram (Ahab's son) and Jezebel (2 Kings 9). The name &quot;Jezreel&quot; is used symbolically in the Book of Hosea to represent God's judgment on the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel (Hosea 1:4) and the future restoration of Israel (Hosea 1:11). The city was a significant administrative center during the reigns of the kings of Israel and was known for its strategic location and fertile surroundings.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Jezreel Valley, a strategically important and fertile valley in northern Israel, was the site of several significant battles in the Bible.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Jezreel Valley, also known as the Plain of Esdraelon, is a large, fertile valley located in northern Israel. It is situated between the Galilee region in the north and the Samaria region in the south. The valley is known for its rich agricultural land and has been an important trade route since ancient times. In the Bible, the Jezreel Valley is mentioned as the site of several significant battles. In Judges 6:33, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples camped in the valley to attack Israel, but Gideon defeated them with God's help. The valley is also associated with the defeat of Saul and his sons by the Philistines (1 Samuel 29:1, 31:1-7). In Hosea 1:5, the prophet uses the name &quot;Jezreel&quot; symbolically to represent God's judgment on Israel, saying that God will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel. Some scholars believe that the Jezreel Valley may be the site of the future Battle of Armageddon mentioned in Revelation 16:16, although this interpretation is debated.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Joppa, an ancient seaport on the Mediterranean coast, served as the main port for Jerusalem in biblical times.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Joppa, also known as Japho in the Old Testament and modern-day Jaffa, is one of the oldest cities in the world, located on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. It is first mentioned as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:46). Joppa served as the main seaport for Jerusalem, and it was here that the cedar wood from Lebanon arrived for the construction of Solomon's Temple (2 Chronicles 2:16) and later for the Second Temple (Ezra 3:7). The prophet Jonah set sail from Joppa when he tried to flee from God's command to preach in Nineveh (Jonah 1:3). In the New Testament, Joppa is significant as the place where Peter stayed with Simon the tanner and had a vision that led him to preach to the Gentiles (Acts 9:36-43; 10:5-23). It was also the home of Tabitha (Dorcas), whom Peter raised from the dead (Acts 9:36-42). Joppa has a long and rich history, and its strategic location made it an important city throughout biblical times.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Jordan River and its surrounding region played a significant role in the history of Israel, from the time of the patriarchs to the New Testament era.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Jordan River, the most prominent river in the Bible, flows from north to south through the Jordan Valley and empties into the Dead Sea. The river and its surrounding region, also known as the Jordan Valley or the Plain of Jordan, are mentioned numerous times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The Jordan River formed the eastern boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:12) and was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership when they entered Canaan (Joshua 3-4). The river also served as a boundary between the tribes settling east and west of the Jordan (Joshua 22:25). Several significant events took place along the Jordan, including the parting of the river for Elijah and Elisha (2 Kings 2:6-14), Naaman's healing (2 Kings 5:10-14), and John the Baptist's ministry of baptism (Matthew 3:5-6; Mark 1:5). The Jordan Valley was known for its fertile land, as seen in Lot's choice to settle there (Genesis 13:10-11). The region also served as a refuge for Elijah (1 Kings 17:3-5) and David (2 Samuel 17:22-24). In the New Testament, Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9) and conducted ministry in the region (Matthew 4:25; 19:1). The Jordan River and its surrounding area continue to hold great significance for Christians, Jews, and Muslims today.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Jotbathah, a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey, known for its streams of water (Numbers 33:33-34; Deuteronomy 10:7).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Jotbathah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Egypt (Numbers 33:33-34). It is described as a land with brooks of water (Deuteronomy 10:7), suggesting that it was a refreshing and well-watered location. The Israelites arrived at Jotbathah after camping at Hor-haggidgad and before moving on to Abronah. The exact location of Jotbathah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula or the Arabah region, south of the Dead Sea.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Judea, the southern region of Israel, was the center of Jewish life and culture in biblical times, with Jerusalem as its capital.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Judea, also known as Judah, was the southern region of ancient Israel, located between Samaria to the north and Idumea to the south. The area was named after the tribe of Judah, which settled there after the Israelites conquered Canaan. Judea was known for its hilly terrain and its capital, Jerusalem, which served as the religious and political center of the Jewish people. The region played a significant role throughout biblical history, from the time of the judges to the New Testament era. Many important events took place in Judea, including the reigns of King David and King Solomon, the construction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, and the ministries of Jesus and the early church. Judea was the birthplace of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5, 65) and Jesus (Matthew 2:1, 5). During the New Testament period, Judea was a Roman province, and it was the scene of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection (Luke 23:5; John 19:19-20). The early Christian church began in Jerusalem and spread throughout Judea (Acts 1:8; 2:9). The region's history, culture, and religious significance made it a central focus of both the Old and New Testaments.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Kadesh (Kadesh-barnea, En-mishpat), an important oasis in the Wilderness of Zin, was a key location during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Kadesh, also known as Kadesh-barnea and En-mishpat, was an important oasis located in the Wilderness of Zin, near the border of Edom (Numbers 20:16). It served as a significant campsite for the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. Kadesh was the place from which Moses sent the twelve spies to explore the land of Canaan (Numbers 13:26; 32:8). It was also the site where Miriam died and was buried (Numbers 20:1) and where Moses and Aaron disobeyed God by striking the rock to bring forth water (Numbers 20:10-13). The Israelites spent a considerable amount of time at Kadesh (Deuteronomy 1:46) before moving on to other locations in the wilderness. Kadesh was known for its spring (En-mishpat, meaning &quot;spring of judgment,&quot; Genesis 14:7) and was a strategic location along trade routes. It also marked the southern boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:4; Joshua 15:3). The Bible mentions several events that took place at Kadesh, including the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16) and the Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land, resulting in their forty-year wandering in the wilderness (Numbers 14; Deuteronomy 1:19-46).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Kain was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:57). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, and no further information about its history or significance is provided. Some scholars suggest that Kain may be associated with the Kenites, a nomadic tribe mentioned in Numbers 24:22. The Kenites were known for their association with the Israelites, particularly through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro (Judges 1:16). However, the connection between the town of Kain and the Kenites is not explicitly stated in the Bible. The exact location of Kain is unknown.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Kanah and Cana are two distinct places mentioned in the Bible. Kanah was a town that formed part of the boundary of the tribe of Asher, located near Sidon (Joshua 19:28). It is associated with the modern Wadi Qana, a stream that flows westward into the Mediterranean Sea, just north of Joppa. ¶Cana, on the other hand, was a village in Galilee where Jesus performed his first miracle, turning water into wine at a wedding feast (John 2:1, 11). Jesus later healed a royal official's son from Capernaum while in Cana (John 4:46). Nathanael, one of Jesus' disciples, was also from Cana (John 21:2). The exact location of Cana is uncertain, but it is generally identified with either Kafr Kanna or Khirbet Qana, both located in the hills of Galilee, not far from Nazareth.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Kedesh, also known as Kedesh-naphtali, was a significant city in the northern part of Canaan. It was originally a Canaanite city, ruled by a king who was defeated by Joshua during the conquest of the land (Joshua 12:22). After the conquest, Kedesh was allotted to the tribe of Naphtali (Joshua 19:37) and designated as a Levitical city (Joshua 21:32) and a city of refuge (Joshua 20:7). Cities of refuge were established to provide sanctuary for those who accidentally killed someone, protecting them from revenge until a proper trial could be held. Kedesh was also the hometown of Barak, who, along with Deborah, led the Israelites to victory against Sisera and the Canaanites (Judges 4:6, 9-11). The city was later captured by Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, during his invasion of Israel (2 Kings 15:29). The exact location of Kedesh is disputed, but it is generally identified with the modern-day site of Tel Kedesh, located in the Upper Galilee region of Israel, near the border with Lebanon.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Keilah was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowland region, of Judah (Joshua 15:44). During the time of King Saul, the Philistines attacked Keilah and robbed the threshing floors. David, who was fleeing from Saul at the time, inquired of the Lord and was directed to go and save Keilah (1 Samuel 23:1-5). David and his men successfully defended the town against the Philistines. However, when Saul heard that David was in Keilah, he planned to besiege the city and capture him. David again sought the Lord's guidance and learned that the people of Keilah would surrender him to Saul. As a result, David and his men left Keilah and continued to evade Saul (1 Samuel 23:7-13). Keilah is also mentioned in the genealogies of Judah (1 Chronicles 4:19) and in the context of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:17-18). The exact location of Keilah is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the western foothills of Judah, possibly at the site of Khirbet Qila, about 8 miles northwest of Hebron.</ext_description>

During the time of Moses, the city was captured by Nobah, a descendant of Manasseh, who renamed it after himself (Numbers 32:42). The city was also known as Nophah (Numbers 21:30). In the time of Gideon, Kenath was mentioned as being near Jogbehah, where Gideon pursued and defeated the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna (Judges 8:11). Later, according to 1 Chronicles 2:23, Geshur and Aram captured Kenath and its villages, totaling sixty towns. This suggests that the city and its surrounding area were of significant size and importance. The exact location of Kenath is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the modern-day Hauran region of Syria, possibly at the site of Qanawat, which preserves the ancient name.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Kibroth-hattaavah, which means &quot;graves of craving,&quot; was a place where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Mount Sinai (Numbers 33:16-17). At this location, the people complained about the lack of meat and expressed their desire to return to Egypt (Numbers 11:4-6). In response to their complaint, God sent quail for the people to eat. However, while the meat was still between their teeth, God struck them with a severe plague, and many died (Numbers 11:31-34). The place was named Kibroth-hattaavah because of the graves of those who had craved meat. Moses later reminded the Israelites of this incident as an example of their rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 9:22). The exact location of Kibroth-hattaavah in the Sinai Peninsula is unknown.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Kidron Valley, also referred to as the Valley of Jehoshaphat, is a deep ravine located east of Jerusalem, separating the city from the Mount of Olives. The valley is mentioned several times in the Bible as the location of important events. King David crossed the Kidron Valley when fleeing from his son Absalom (2 Samuel 15:23). King Asa burned the idol of his mother, Maacah, in the Kidron Valley (1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chronicles 15:16). During the religious reforms of King Josiah, the objects used for idol worship were burned and their ashes thrown into the Kidron Valley (2 Kings 23:4, 6, 12). The valley is also associated with the prophetic visions of Joel, who referred to it as the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where God would gather the nations for judgment (Joel 3:2, 12). In the New Testament, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples to enter the Garden of Gethsemane on the night of his betrayal (John 18:1). The Kidron Valley has been used as a burial place for thousands of years, and it holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The King's Highway was an ancient trade route that ran through the kingdoms of Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan River. It was a vital commercial and military route connecting Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, Moses sent messengers to the kings of Edom and Sihon, requesting passage along the King's Highway (Numbers 20:17; 21:22). The Israelites promised to stay on the highway and not disturb the fields or vineyards, but both kings refused to grant them passage. As a result, the Israelites had to detour around Edom and defeat Sihon in battle to continue their journey. The King's Highway played a significant role in the region's history and is still identifiable in parts of modern-day Jordan.</ext_description>

Melchizedek blessed Abraham and received a tithe from him. Later, in 2 Samuel 18:18, it is mentioned that Absalom, King David's rebellious son, had erected a pillar for himself in the King's Valley during his lifetime, as he had no son to preserve his name. The exact location of the King's Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated near Jerusalem, possibly in the Kidron Valley or the Hinnom Valley.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Kiriathaim, also known as Kerioth, was a Moabite city later allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Numbers 32:37; Joshua 13:19; Jeremiah 48:1, 23).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Kiriathaim, also referred to as Kerioth or &quot;cities,&quot; was a city in Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It is first mentioned in Numbers 32:37 as one of the cities rebuilt by the Reubenites after the conquest of the region. Joshua 13:19 confirms that Kiriathaim was allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of their inheritance. However, the city later appears to have reverted to Moabite control, as the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of God's judgment against Moab, specifically mentioning Kiriathaim (Jeremiah 48:1, 23; Ezekiel 25:9). The name &quot;Kiriathaim&quot; means &quot;double city&quot; or &quot;two cities,&quot; possibly indicating that it consisted of two parts or was a significant city in the region. The exact location of Kiriathaim is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern-day town of Quraiyat in Jordan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Kiriath-jearim, a city where the ark of the covenant resided for 20 years (1 Samuel 7:1-2).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Kiriath-jearim, also referred to as Kiriath-arim, Kiriath-baal, Baalah, Baale-judah, or Jaar, was a city located on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (Joshua 15:9, 18:14-15). It was one of the four Gibeonite cities that deceived Joshua into making a treaty with them (Joshua 9:17). The ark of the covenant was brought to Kiriath-jearim after being returned by the Philistines and remained there for 20 years (1 Samuel 6:21, 7:1-2). David later retrieved the ark from Kiriath-jearim to bring it to Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 13:5-6, 2 Chronicles 1:4). The city was also the hometown of the prophet Uriah (Jeremiah 26:20). Kiriath-jearim was resettled by the descendants of Judah after the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 7:29, Ezra 2:25).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Lachish, a fortified city in Judah, captured by Joshua and later by the Assyrians (Joshua 10; 2 Kings 18:14, 19:8).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Lachish was a significant fortified city located in the Shephelah region of Judah (Joshua 15:39). It was one of the Amorite cities that formed an alliance against Joshua and the Israelites, but it was captured and its king was defeated (Joshua 10; 12:11). Later, Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fortified Lachish as part of his defense strategy (2 Chronicles 11:9). During the reign of King Amaziah, Lachish served as a refuge for the king when he fled from a conspiracy in Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:19; 2 Chronicles 25:27). In the time of King Hezekiah, the Assyrian king Sennacherib captured Lachish and used it as a base to send his officials to threaten Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:14, 17; 19:8; 2 Chronicles 32:9; Isaiah 36:2; 37:8). The city was one of the last fortified cities in Judah to fall to the Babylonians during the reign of Zedekiah (Jeremiah 34:7). After the Babylonian exile, Lachish was resettled by the people of Judah (Nehemiah 11:30). The prophet Micah also mentioned Lachish, urging the city to give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath (Micah 1:13).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Laodicea, a city in Asia Minor, known for its lukewarm faith (Revelation 3:14-16).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Laodicea was a city located in the Lycus Valley in the Roman province of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). The city is mentioned several times in the New Testament, particularly in Paul's letter to the Colossians and in the book of Revelation. Paul mentions his concern for the believers in Laodicea, even though he had not personally visited the city (Colossians 2:1). He also sends greetings to the Laodicean church and instructs the Colossians to share his letter with them (Colossians 4:13, 15-16). In the book of Revelation, Laodicea is one of the seven churches addressed by Jesus Christ. The Laodicean church is rebuked for being lukewarm in their faith, neither hot nor cold, and for their self-sufficiency and spiritual complacency (Revelation 3:14-16). Despite their material wealth, Jesus declares them to be spiritually poor, blind, and naked, urging them to repent and seek true spiritual riches from Him (Revelation 3:17-18).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Lebanon, a mountainous region north of Israel, known for its cedar trees and as a symbol of strength and beauty (1 Kings 4:33; Psalm 92:12).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Lebanon is a mountainous region located north of Israel, known for its majestic cedar trees and natural beauty. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament. The cedars of Lebanon were highly prized for their quality and were used in the construction of the Temple and other important buildings (1 Kings 5:6, 9, 14; 2 Chronicles 2:8, 16; Ezra 3:7). Lebanon is often used as a symbol of strength, prosperity, and beauty (Psalm 72:16; 92:12; Song of Solomon 4:11, 15; 5:15). It is also mentioned in the context of God's power and judgment (Psalm 29:5, 6; Isaiah 2:13; 10:34; Jeremiah 22:6, 23; Habakkuk 2:17). Lebanon is described as part of the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 1:7; 11:24; Joshua 1:4) and was a region where some Canaanite inhabitants remained (Judges 3:3). The beauty and majesty of Lebanon are used to illustrate the glory and splendor of the future kingdom of God (Isaiah 35:2; 60:13; Hosea 14:5-7).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Lehi is mentioned in the book of Judges as a place where Samson, empowered by the Spirit of God, fought against the Philistines. The Philistines went up and encamped in Judah, spreading out in Lehi (Judges 15:9). When Samson was handed over to the Philistines by the men of Judah, he broke free from his bonds and struck down a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey (Judges 15:14-15). After this victory, Samson was thirsty, and God miraculously provided water for him to drink from a hollow place in Lehi (Judges 15:19). The name &quot;Lehi&quot; is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:11 as the location of a battle where Shammah, one of David's mighty men, stood his ground against the Philistines and achieved a great victory.</ext_description>

However, Jews from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and stirred up the crowd against them, leading to Paul being stoned and left for dead outside the city (Acts 14:19-20). Paul later returned to Lystra to strengthen the disciples (Acts 14:21). Timothy, a young disciple who accompanied Paul on his missionary journeys, was from Lystra (Acts 16:1-2).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Maacah (Maacath), a region near Geshur (Deuteronomy 3:14; Joshua 12:5), and the name of several individuals in the Old Testament.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Maacah (or Maacath) is the name of a region and several individuals in the Old Testament. As a region, Maacah was located near Geshur, east of the Jordan River (Deuteronomy 3:14; Joshua 12:5; 13:11, 13). The Israelites allowed the Geshurites and Maacathites to remain in the land (Joshua 13:13). Maacah is also mentioned as one of the regions from which the Ammonites hired chariots and horsemen to fight against David (2 Samuel 10:6, 8; 1 Chronicles 19:7). ¶Several individuals in the Old Testament also bear the name Maacah, including a son of Nahor (Genesis 22:24), the mother of Absalom (2 Samuel 3:3), the father of Achish, king of Gath (1 Kings 2:39), the wife of Machir (1 Chronicles 7:15-16), and the wife of Jehiel (1 Chronicles 8:29; 9:35). Additionally, a Maacathite named Eliphelet was one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:34), and Jezaniah, son of the Maacathite, was one of the commanders who survived the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:23; Jeremiah 40:8).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Macedonia, a region in northern Greece where Paul preached the gospel and established churches (Acts 16:9-12; 20:1-3).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Macedonia was a region located in northern Greece, which played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity. The apostle Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia calling him to come and help them (Acts 16:9), leading Paul and his companions to travel to Macedonia and preach the gospel there (Acts 16:10-12). Paul visited several cities in Macedonia, including Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea (Acts 16-17). He later revisited Macedonia during his third missionary journey (Acts 20:1-3). The churches in Macedonia, particularly the Philippians and Thessalonians, were known for their faith, generosity, and support of Paul's ministry (2 Corinthians 8:1-5; Philippians 4:15-16; 1 Thessalonians 1:7-8). Paul wrote epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians, which are included in the New Testament. Macedonia is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travel plans (Romans 15:26; 1 Corinthians 16:5; 2 Corinthians 1:16) and his co-workers, such as Sopater, Aristarchus, and Secundus (Acts 19:29; 20:4; 27:2).</ext_description>

The field and the cave were deeded to Abraham as a possession for a burying place (Genesis 23:20). Abraham himself was later buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael (Genesis 25:9-10). The cave also became the burial place for Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah (Genesis 49:30-31), as well as Jacob (Genesis 50:13). The cave of Machpelah served as a significant burial site for the patriarchs and their wives, and it represented the Israelites' connection to the land of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Magadan, also known as Dalmanutha, is mentioned in the New Testament as a place Jesus visited after feeding the four thousand (Matthew 15:39; Mark 8:10). It was located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Some scholars suggest that Magadan may be the same place as Magdala, the hometown of Mary Magdalene, one of Jesus' followers (Matthew 27:56, 61; 28:1; Mark 15:40, 47; 16:1, 9; Luke 8:2; 24:10; John 19:25; 20:1, 18). Mary Magdalene is described as a woman from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons and who supported Jesus' ministry. She witnessed Jesus' crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. The exact relationship between the names Magadan, Dalmanutha, and Magdala is uncertain, but they likely refer to the same general area on the Sea of Galilee.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mahanaim, a place east of the Jordan River where Jacob met angels and David found refuge during Absalom's rebellion (Genesis 32:2; 2 Samuel 17:24, 27).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mahanaim was a city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory allocated to the tribe of Gad (Joshua 13:26, 30). It was designated as a Levitical city for the Merarites (Joshua 21:38; 1 Chronicles 6:80). Mahanaim is first mentioned in Genesis 32:2, where Jacob encountered angels on his way back to Canaan, and he named the place Mahanaim, meaning &quot;two camps.&quot; During the reign of King David, Mahanaim served as a refuge for David when he fled from his son Absalom's rebellion (2 Samuel 17:24, 27). Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was also based in Mahanaim when he ruled over Israel (2 Samuel 2:8, 12, 29). Later, during Solomon's reign, Mahanaim was the center of one of the twelve districts governed by Solomon's officers (1 Kings 4:14).</ext_description>

After Paul's ship was caught in a violent storm, it ran aground on a sandbar near Malta (Acts 27:39-44). Paul and the other survivors made it safely to shore, where they were welcomed by the islanders (Acts 28:1-2). During his three-month stay on Malta, Paul healed the father of Publius, the chief official of the island, as well as many others who were sick (Acts 28:7-9). The kindness shown by the people of Malta to Paul and his companions exemplifies the hospitality that Christians should extend to others (Acts 28:10).</ext_description>

After Nabal's death, David married Abigail (1 Samuel 25:39-42). Maon is also mentioned as one of the places where David and his men sought refuge from King Saul (1 Samuel 23:24-25). The wilderness of Maon, located near the city, was one of the areas where David hid from Saul. Additionally, the Maonites are listed among the oppressors of Israel during the time of the judges (Judges 10:12).</ext_description>

The Israelites grumbled against Moses, but the Lord showed him a tree which, when cast into the water, made it sweet (Exodus 15:24-25). God then tested the Israelites, promising to protect them from diseases if they obeyed His commands (Exodus 15:25-26).

		<ext_description>Masrekah was the royal city of Samlah, one of the ancient kings of Edom who reigned before any Israelite king (Genesis 36:31, 36; 1 Chronicles 1:47). The name Masrekah may mean &quot;place of choice vines,&quot; but the exact location of the city is unknown. Some scholars have proposed that it might be identified with a town called En-Masrak or Ain Mafrak, located about eight miles south of Petra, but this remains a conjecture without conclusive evidence.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Massah, a place in the wilderness where the Israelites tested the Lord by demanding water (Exodus 17:7; Deuteronomy 6:16; 9:22; 33:8; Psalm 95:8).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Massah was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord by demanding water (Exodus 17:7). The name Massah means &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;temptation.&quot; At this place, the people grumbled against Moses, questioning whether the Lord was among them or not. Moses, following God's instructions, struck the rock at Horeb, and water came out for the people to drink (Exodus 17:5-6). The incident at Massah is later recalled as an example of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith (Deuteronomy 6:16; 9:22; 33:8; Psalm 95:8), serving as a warning for future generations not to test the Lord.</ext_description>

The Moabite Stone, an important archaeological find, mentions Medeba as a city that the Moabite King Mesha had captured from Israel. The prophet Isaiah, in his oracle against Moab, mentions Medeba as one of the cities that would mourn over the coming destruction (Isaiah 15:2).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Media was an ancient kingdom located in western Iran, which played a significant role in biblical history. The Medes, along with the Babylonians, conquered the Assyrian Empire in 612 BC (Isaiah 13:17; Jeremiah 51:11, 28). Later, the Medes joined forces with the Persians to form the powerful Medo-Persian Empire. This empire, under the rule of Cyrus the Great, conquered Babylon in 539 BC (Daniel 5:28, 31). The Medes are mentioned in the book of Esther as one of the peoples under the rule of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) (Esther 1:3, 14, 18; 10:2). The Medes were also involved in the deportation of the Israelites from the northern kingdom (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11). The prophet Daniel served in the Medo-Persian court (Daniel 6:8, 12, 15; 9:1; 11:1) and interpreted the handwriting on the wall, which announced the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians (Daniel 5:28). Medes were among the peoples present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Megiddo was a city of great strategic importance located in the Jezreel Valley, guarding the main trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia. It was one of the cities conquered by Joshua during the Israelite conquest of Canaan (Joshua 12:21). Megiddo was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh but was not fully taken from the Canaanites (Joshua 17:11; Judges 1:27). The city is mentioned in the song of Deborah as the site of a great battle against the Canaanites (Judges 5:19). King Solomon fortified Megiddo as one of his key cities (1 Kings 9:15). The city continued to play a significant role in later history, with King Josiah of Judah being killed by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt at Megiddo (2 Kings 23:29-30; 2 Chronicles 35:22). The name Armageddon, derived from the Hebrew &quot;Har Megiddo&quot; (hill of Megiddo), appears in the book of Revelation as the site of the final battle between the forces of good and evil (Revelation 16:16).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Memphis was an important city in ancient Egypt, located south of modern Cairo. It served as the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom period and remained a significant cultural and religious center throughout much of Egyptian history. In the Bible, Memphis is mentioned primarily in the context of prophecies against Egypt. The prophet Isaiah speaks of the princes of Memphis as being deceived and leading Egypt astray (Isaiah 19:13). Jeremiah mentions Memphis as one of the cities where the Jews fled to escape the Babylonian invasion, but he warns that they will not find safety there (Jeremiah 2:16; 44:1; 46:14, 19). Ezekiel prophesies that God will execute judgments against the idols and princes of Memphis (Ezekiel 30:13, 16). Hosea also refers to Memphis (Moph) as a place where the Israelites will be exiled and will die (Hosea 9:6).</ext_description>

It was designated as a Levitical city, given to the Merarite clan (Joshua 21:37; 1 Chronicles 6:79). The Levites were assigned cities throughout Israel to live in and serve the people. In later history, Mephaath appears to have come under Moabite control, as it is mentioned in Jeremiah's prophecy against Moab (Jeremiah 48:21).

		<short_description>Meribah, a place where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord, and where water came from the rock (Exodus 17:7; Deuteronomy 33:8; Psalm 95:8).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Meribah was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses and tested the Lord (Exodus 17:7). The name Meribah means &quot;quarrel&quot; or &quot;contention.&quot; The people complained about the lack of water, and Moses, following God's instructions, struck the rock, and water came out for the people to drink (Exodus 17:5-6). The incident at Meribah is remembered as an example of Israel's rebellion and lack of faith (Deuteronomy 33:8; Psalm 95:8). It serves as a warning not to harden one's heart against God as the Israelites did at Meribah.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Meribah-kadesh, also known as Meribah, was a location in the wilderness where the Israelites quarreled with Moses, and Moses disobeyed God (Numbers 20:13). The people complained about the lack of water, and God instructed Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water. However, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water came out abundantly (Numbers 20:7-11). Because Moses and Aaron did not trust and honor God in the sight of the Israelites, they were not allowed to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 20:12; 27:14; Deuteronomy 32:51). The incident at Meribah-kadesh is remembered as a time when the Israelites rebelled against God and Moses (Psalm 81:7; 106:32). In Ezekiel's vision of the future boundaries of Israel, Meribah-kadesh is mentioned as a point on the southern border (Ezekiel 47:19; 48:28).</ext_description>

A coalition of Canaanite kings, led by Jabin king of Hazor, gathered together to fight against Israel at the waters of Merom (Joshua 11:5). Joshua and the Israelite army attacked them by surprise, defeating them and pursuing them until no survivors were left (Joshua 11:7-8). The exact location of the waters of Merom is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be in the vicinity of Lake Huleh in northern Israel. The decisive victory at Merom was a significant milestone in the Israelite conquest of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Meronothite is a term used to describe two individuals in the Bible. First, Jehdeiah the Meronothite is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:30 as the man in charge of King David's donkeys. This suggests that he may have been from a place called Meronoth, although the exact location is unknown. Second, Jadon the Meronothite is mentioned in Nehemiah 3:7 as one of the people who helped repair the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. The term Meronothite likely indicates that Jadon was from the same place as Jehdeiah, but no further information is provided about this location or its significance.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Meroz is a place mentioned only once in the Bible, in the Song of Deborah and Barak (Judges 5:23). The exact location of Meroz is unknown, but it was likely situated near the Kishon River, close to where the Israelites, led by Deborah and Barak, fought against the Canaanite army commanded by Sisera. In the song, the angel of the Lord pronounces a curse upon Meroz and its inhabitants for not coming to help in the battle against Sisera. The severity of the curse suggests that Meroz may have been in a position to provide significant assistance but chose not to do so. Some scholars propose identifying Meroz with el-Murussus, a village about 5 miles northwest of Beisan, on the slopes north of the Jezreel Valley, but this remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Meshech was a nation descended from Japheth, one of the sons of Noah (Genesis 10:2). In the Bible, Meshech is often mentioned together with Tubal, suggesting a close association between the two peoples. Meshech and Tubal are described as trading partners of Tyre, supplying the city with slaves and bronze vessels (Ezekiel 27:13). The two nations are also mentioned as allies of Gog, the chief prince of Magog, in the prophecy of Ezekiel concerning the future invasion of Israel (Ezekiel 38:2, 3; 39:1). The psalmist laments living among the tents of Meshech, using it as a metaphor for dwelling among hostile and barbaric people (Psalm 120:5). Historically, Meshech is identified with the Mushki or Muski, an ancient people who lived in the region of Cappadocia in Asia Minor.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mesopotamia, meaning &quot;between the rivers,&quot; refers to the ancient region located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where Abraham lived before God called him to go to Canaan (Genesis 24:10; Acts 7:2). During the time of the judges, the Israelites were oppressed by Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for eight years until Othniel, Caleb's younger brother, defeated him (Judges 3:8, 10). Mesopotamia was also the homeland of Balaam, the prophet hired by Balak, king of Moab, to curse Israel (Deuteronomy 23:4). In the New Testament, Mesopotamia is mentioned as one of the regions from which devout Jews had come to Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost (Acts 2:9). Throughout history, Mesopotamia was home to many powerful civilizations, including the Sumerians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, who played significant roles in biblical history.</ext_description>

Jonathan, Saul's son, launched a daring attack on the Philistine garrison near Michmash, which led to a great victory for Israel (1 Samuel 14:5, 31). After the Babylonian exile, some people from Michmash returned to resettle in their hometown (Ezra 2:27; Nehemiah 7:31; 11:31).

		<short_description>Midian, a nation descended from Abraham through Keturah (Genesis 25:2), which oppressed Israel during the time of the judges (Judges 6-8) and was later defeated by Gideon (Judges 7-8).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Midian was a nation descended from Abraham through his wife Keturah (Genesis 25:2). The Midianites lived in the desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the area east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Moses fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian and married Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest (Exodus 2:15-22). Jethro later visited Moses and offered him wise counsel (Exodus 18:1-27). ¶During the time of the judges, the Midianites, along with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, oppressed Israel for seven years (Judges 6:1-6). God raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from the Midianites (Judges 6:11-24). Gideon, with a small army of 300 men, defeated the Midianites and their allies, who were &quot;as numerous as locusts&quot; (Judges 7-8). ¶The Midianites were involved in the incident at Peor, where Israelite men were enticed into sexual immorality and idolatry (Numbers 25:1-18). As a result, God commanded Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites (Numbers 25:17-18; 31:1-54). ¶In later biblical history, the Midianites are mentioned as traders who bought Joseph from his brothers and sold him into slavery in Egypt (Genesis 37:28, 36). The prophet Isaiah refers to the defeat of Midian as a symbol of God's power to deliver his people (Isaiah 9:4; 10:26). The Midianites are also mentioned in the genealogy of Edom (Genesis 36:35; 1 Chronicles 1:46) and in a psalm calling for God's judgment on Israel's enemies (Psalm 83:9).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Migdol is mentioned in the Bible as a place near the Red Sea where the Israelites camped during their Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 14:2; Numbers 33:7). The name Migdol is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;migdal,&quot; meaning &quot;tower&quot; or &quot;fortress.&quot; It is believed to be a reference to a fortified border city in ancient Egypt. ¶In the prophetic books, Migdol is mentioned as one of the cities in Egypt where Jewish refugees settled after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 44:1). The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel also include Migdol in their prophecies against Egypt, indicating that it was a significant city (Jeremiah 46:14; Ezekiel 29:10; 30:6). ¶The exact location of the biblical Migdol is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the present-day Suez Canal. Some scholars have proposed that it might be identified with the ancient Egyptian city of &quot;Tjeku&quot; or &quot;Tjel,&quot; known in Greek as &quot;Sile,&quot; which served as a frontier fortress on the eastern border of Egypt.</ext_description>

In this passage, Migron is listed among the towns that the Assyrian army would pass through on their way to Jerusalem. The exact location of Migron is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated near Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin, a short distance north of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Miletus was an ancient city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), near the mouth of the Maeander River. It was a significant port city and a center of trade and culture in the Greco-Roman world. ¶In the New Testament, Miletus is mentioned in connection with the Apostle Paul's missionary journeys. During his third journey, Paul stopped at Miletus on his way to Jerusalem and sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus to meet him there (Acts 20:15, 17). He delivered a farewell address to the Ephesian elders, warning them about false teachers and encouraging them to remain faithful to God (Acts 20:18-35). ¶In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Trophimus, one of his companions, ill at Miletus. This statement provides insight into the challenges and hardships faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled and spread the gospel message. ¶Miletus was known for its wool industry and its intellectual and artistic achievements. It was the birthplace of several notable Greek philosophers, including Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who were among the first to seek rational explanations for natural phenomena.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Millo (Akra), a fortification in Jerusalem built by Solomon (1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27) and repaired by Hezekiah (2 Chronicles 32:5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Millo, also known as Akra, was a fortified structure in ancient Jerusalem, first mentioned during the reign of King David (2 Samuel 5:9; 1 Chronicles 11:8). The name &quot;Millo&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;millu',&quot; meaning &quot;filling&quot; or &quot;terrace,&quot; while &quot;Akra&quot; comes from the Greek word for &quot;citadel&quot; or &quot;stronghold.&quot; ¶King Solomon further strengthened and expanded Millo as part of his building projects in Jerusalem (1 Kings 9:15, 24). The construction of Millo was a significant undertaking, requiring a large workforce and resources (1 Kings 11:27). ¶During the reign of King Hezekiah, Millo was repaired and fortified as part of the preparations for the Assyrian invasion (2 Chronicles 32:5). The &quot;House of Millo&quot; is mentioned in connection with the coronation of King Joash (2 Kings 12:20), suggesting that it may have served as a royal residence or an important administrative center. ¶The exact location and nature of Millo are not clearly described in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been a terraced structure or a landfill that supported the fortifications and buildings in the City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem. Others suggest that it could have been a separate fortress or citadel within the city. Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem have uncovered remains of ancient fortifications and structures that may be associated with Millo, but the precise identification remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Misrephoth-maim is mentioned in Joshua 11:8 as a place near the city of Sidon where the Canaanite forces fled after being defeated by Joshua and the Israelites. In the context of the conquest of Canaan, Joshua pursued the Canaanite kings and their armies as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, striking them down until no survivors were left. The exact location of Misrephoth-maim is uncertain, but its proximity to Sidon suggests that it was situated along the Mediterranean coast in the region of modern-day Lebanon.</ext_description>

It is listed between Terah and Hashmonah in the itinerary of the Israelites' journey.

		<ext_description>Mitylene was the capital city of the island of Lesbos, located in the northeastern Aegean Sea. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Acts 20:14, as a stop on the Apostle Paul's journey from Troas to Jerusalem. Paul had traveled by foot from Troas to Assos, while his companions sailed to Assos, where they took Paul on board and sailed to Mitylene. The city was known for its beauty, culture, and literary heritage, being the birthplace of the famous poets Sappho and Alcaeus. In the Greco-Roman period, Mitylene was a prosperous and influential city, with a well-developed harbor and a strategic location on trade routes.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Mizar, a mountain mentioned in a psalm of lament, possibly representing a place of remembrance or longing for God's presence (Psalm 42:6).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Mizar is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Psalm 42:6, as part of a psalm of lament expressing the writer's longing for God's presence. The psalmist, one of the sons of Korah, remembers God from the land of the Jordan, the peaks of Hermon, and the Mount of Mizar. The exact location of Mount Mizar is unknown, and it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it may be a reference to a smaller hill or peak in the vicinity of Mount Hermon, while others propose that it could be a symbolic name representing a place of remembrance or spiritual significance for the psalmist. The name &quot;Mizar&quot; comes from a Hebrew word meaning &quot;littleness&quot; or &quot;insignificance,&quot; which may indicate the psalmist's sense of humility or despair in the face of his circumstances.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mizpah, also known as Mizpeh, Ramah, Ramathaim-zophim, or Arimathea, was a city located in the tribal territory of Benjamin, near the border with Ephraim. It was an important religious and political center during the period of the judges and the early monarchy. ¶During the time of the judges, the Israelites gathered at Mizpah to address the crisis involving the tribe of Benjamin and the concubine at Gibeah (Judges 20:1, 3; 21:1, 5, 8). Later, the prophet Samuel summoned the people to Mizpah for prayer, repentance, and deliverance from the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:5-7, 11-12, 16). Samuel also gathered the Israelites at Mizpah to appoint Saul as their first king (1 Samuel 10:17). ¶Mizpah was the hometown and burial place of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:19; 2:11; 7:17; 8:4; 15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23; 20:1; 25:1; 28:3). It was also the city of Joseph of Arimathea, the wealthy disciple who provided the tomb for Jesus' burial (Matthew 27:57; Mark 15:43; Luke 23:50-51; John 19:38). ¶During the divided monarchy, King Asa of Judah fortified Mizpah using materials from the dismantled fortifications of Ramah (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). After the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, Mizpah served as the administrative center for the remnant of Judah under Gedaliah (2 Kings 25:23, 25; Jeremiah 40:6, 8, 10, 12-13, 15; 41:1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 16).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Valley of Mizpeh, also known as Mizpah, is mentioned in Joshua 11:3 and 11:8 as a region near Mount Hermon in the northern part of Canaan. It was inhabited by the Hivites, one of the Canaanite tribes. The Canaanite kings of the region, including Jabin king of Hazor, gathered their forces in the Valley of Mizpeh to fight against Joshua and the Israelites. Joshua, following God's command, launched a surprise attack against the Canaanite coalition and decisively defeated them, pursuing them as far as Great Sidon and the Valley of Mizpeh to the east (Joshua 11:8). The exact location of the Valley of Mizpeh is not certain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of Mount Hermon, possibly in the Beqaa Valley or the Huleh Valley.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Moab was an ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea in present-day Jordan, often in conflict with Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Moab was an ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea in the central Transjordan region, in what is now the country of Jordan. The Moabites were a Semitic people descended from Moab, the son of Lot by his elder daughter (Gen. 19:37). ¶The Moabites first appear in the biblical record at the time of the Exodus. Balak, the king of Moab, feared the Israelites and hired Balaam to curse them (Num. 22-24). The Moabites worshipped the god Chemosh and induced some Israelites to join in their idolatrous sacrifices (Num. 25:1-2). ¶Throughout the time of the judges and early monarchy, the Moabites were in frequent conflict with Israel. King Saul fought against them (1 Sam. 14:47), and David subjugated them and made them tributaries (2 Sam. 8:2,12). After the division of the kingdom, the Moabites regained their independence. ¶During the reign of King Omri of Israel (c. 884-872 BC), who is mentioned in 1 Kings 16:23-28, Moabite lands were reconquered. However, about 40 years later, the Moabite king Mesha rebelled against Israel, as recorded on the famous Moabite Stone discovered in 1868 in Dibon (modern Dhiban, Jordan). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Amos all prophesied against Moab (Isa. 15-16, Jer. 48, Ezek. 25:8-11, Amos 2:1-2). After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Jews took refuge in Moab (Jer. 40:11). Moab disappears as a nation from the historical record sometime during the Persian period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The plains of Moab, located east of the Jordan River and opposite Jericho, were where the Israelites camped before entering the Promised Land (Num 22:1; 26:3, 63; 31:12; 33:48-50; 35:1; 36:13; Deut 34:1, 8; Josh 13:32).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The plains of Moab refer to the region east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, where the Israelites camped before entering the Promised Land. This area is mentioned several times in the books of Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua (Num 22:1; 26:3, 63; 31:12; 33:48-50; 35:1; 36:13; Deut 34:1, 8; Josh 13:32). It was in the plains of Moab that the Israelites received instructions from Moses regarding the division of the land, the appointment of cities for the Levites and cities of refuge, and various laws and ordinances. Moses also delivered his final discourses to the Israelites in this location before his death on Mount Nebo, which overlooked the plains of Moab. The region was previously occupied by the Moabites, hence the name, but was conquered by the Amorites before the arrival of the Israelites.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Moladah was a town located in the Negev region of southern Israel. It was initially allotted to the tribe of Judah (Josh 15:26) and later to the tribe of Simeon (Josh 19:2; 1 Chr 4:28). After the Babylonian exile, the town was inhabited by the people of Judah (Neh 11:26). Moladah is mentioned in the lists of towns in the Negev, along with other settlements such as Beersheba, Hormah, and Ziklag. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of modern-day Khirbet el-Waten, approximately 15 miles southeast of Beersheba. The name &quot;Moladah&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;birth&quot; or &quot;kindred.&quot;</ext_description>

		<short_description>Moreh refers to two locations: a place near Shechem where Abraham built an altar (Gen 12:6) and a hill near Gilgal, associated with the blessing and cursing ceremony (Deut 11:30).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Moreh is the name of two distinct locations mentioned in the Bible. The first is a place near Shechem, where Abraham built an altar to the Lord after arriving in Canaan (Gen 12:6). This location is described as being near the great tree (or terebinth) of Moreh, which served as a landmark. It was here that God appeared to Abraham and promised to give the land to his descendants. The second location is a hill near Gilgal, mentioned in Deuteronomy 11:30 in connection with the blessing and cursing ceremony that the Israelites were to perform upon entering the Promised Land. The hill of Moreh was likely situated opposite Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where the ceremony was to take place. The name &quot;Moreh&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;diviner,&quot; possibly indicating the presence of a religious site or oracle in ancient times.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the innermost room of the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem. It was separated from the Holy Place by a veil (Exod. 26:31-33). The Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, was kept in the Most Holy Place (Exod. 25:10-22; 1 Kgs. 8:6). The high priest entered the Most Holy Place only once a year, on the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for the sins of the people (Lev. 16). The Most Holy Place was a perfect cube, measuring 20 cubits in length, width, and height (1 Kgs. 6:20; 2 Chr. 3:8). It was overlaid with pure gold and contained gold cherubim (1 Kgs. 6:28; 2 Chr. 3:10-13). The Most Holy Place represented the dwelling place of God among His people.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's second missionary journey (Acts 16:7-8). Paul and his companions, including Silas and Timothy, had traveled throughout Phrygia and Galatia, but were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia. When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. So, they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas, where Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia asking for help, leading them to cross over to Europe.</ext_description>

As Jesus approached the town gate, He encountered a funeral procession for the only son of a widow. Moved with compassion, Jesus touched the coffin and commanded the young man to arise, and he was restored to life. This miracle was witnessed by a large crowd and led many to recognize Jesus as a great prophet. The exact location of Nain is not certain, but it is believed to be the modern village of Nein, located about 9 miles southeast of Nazareth.</ext_description>

The Spirit of God came upon the messengers, and they also prophesied. This happened three times, and when Saul himself went to Naioth, he too was overcome by the Spirit and prophesied before Samuel. This event gave rise to the saying, &quot;Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot; (1 Sam. 19:24).</ext_description>

Jesus was often referred to as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or &quot;the Nazarene&quot; (Mark 1:24; 10:47; Luke 18:37; 24:19; John 18:5, 7; 19:19; Acts 2:22; 10:38). ¶Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament or in other ancient literature, suggesting it was a small, relatively insignificant village. The Gospels record that Jesus grew up in Nazareth, preached in its synagogue (Luke 4:16-30), and was initially rejected by its inhabitants (Matt. 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6; Luke 4:28-30). ¶In the first century, Nazareth had a negative reputation, as evidenced by Nathanael's question, &quot;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&quot; (John 1:46). However, Jesus' upbringing in Nazareth fulfilled the prophecy that He would be called a Nazarene (Matt. 2:23), a term possibly derived from the Hebrew word &quot;netzer,&quot; meaning &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;shoot,&quot; and alluding to the Messiah (Isa. 11:1).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Nebo, also known as Abarim, was a mountain range east of the Jordan River in Moabite territory. It is most notably the place where Moses was directed by God to view the Promised Land before his death (Deut. 32:49; 34:1). God told Moses to go up to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, and view the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites (Deut. 3:27; 34:1-4). After seeing the land, Moses died on the mountain and was buried by God in an unknown location in the valley of Moab (Deut. 34:5-6). The Israelites, after wandering in the wilderness, camped in the mountains of Abarim before crossing the Jordan River into Canaan (Num. 33:47-48).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Negeb, meaning &quot;south&quot; in Hebrew, refers to the semi-arid region in the southern part of Israel, extending from the Judean hills to the Arabian Desert. It is characterized by its dry climate and sparse vegetation. In the Bible, the Negeb is often mentioned in relation to the patriarchs, the Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan (Gen. 12:9; 13:1; 20:1; 24:62; Num. 13:17, 22; 21:1; Deut. 1:7; 34:3; Josh. 10:40; 11:16; 12:8). ¶The Negeb was allotted to the tribes of Judah and Simeon (Josh. 15:21; 19:8). It served as a refuge for David when he fled from Saul (1 Sam. 27:10; 30:1, 14). The region is also mentioned in prophetic texts, often in the context of God's judgment or restoration (Isa. 21:1; 30:6; Jer. 13:19; 17:26; 32:44; 33:13; Obad. 1:19-20; Zech. 7:7).</ext_description>

Some of the inhabitants of Netophah returned from the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:22; Neh. 7:26). The town was also the hometown of several notable figures, including two of David's mighty men, Maharai and Heleb (2 Sam. 23:28-29; 1 Chr. 11:30; 27:13, 15), and a Levite named Shemaiah (1 Chr. 9:16). Additionally, some Levites from Netophah participated in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah (Neh. 12:28). The &quot;sons of the prophets&quot; from Netophah are mentioned in the context of Gedaliah's governorship after the fall of Jerusalem (2 Kgs. 25:23; Jer. 40:8).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Nicopolis was a city in the Roman province of Epirus, located on the western coast of Greece. It is mentioned in the New Testament in Paul's letter to Titus (Titus 3:12). In this letter, Paul instructs Titus to meet him in Nicopolis, as he had decided to spend the winter there. The city was founded by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) to commemorate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Nicopolis became an important center of trade and culture in the region. Paul's mention of Nicopolis suggests that he may have planned to use the city as a base for missionary work in the surrounding area.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Nile, the major river of Egypt, is mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible, often in relation to the history of Israel and God's judgment on Egypt.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Nile is the longest river in the world and played a crucial role in the history and culture of ancient Egypt. It is mentioned numerous times in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. In the story of Joseph, the Nile and its canals are the setting for Pharaoh's dreams about the seven years of plenty and seven years of famine (Gen. 41:1-3, 17-18). During the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, the Nile was the site of the miraculous plagues, such as the turning of the water into blood (Exod. 7:17-21) and the emergence of frogs from the river (Exod. 8:3-11). The Nile also played a role in the early life of Moses, who was placed in a basket among the reeds of the river as an infant (Exod. 2:3-5). ¶The prophets often used the Nile as a symbol of Egypt's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment (Isa. 19:6-8; Jer. 46:7-8; Ezek. 29:3-9; 30:12; Amos 8:8; 9:5; Nah. 3:8; Zech. 10:11). The Nile was also a source of economic prosperity for Egypt, as it provided water for irrigation and served as a major transportation route (Isa. 23:3, 10).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Nimrim was a place in the land of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned in the Bible in the context of prophetic oracles against Moab (Isa. 15:6; Jer. 48:34). The waters of Nimrim are described as being desolate or dried up, symbolizing the devastation that would come upon Moab as a result of God's judgment. The exact location of Nimrim is uncertain, but it was likely situated near a spring or stream that provided water for the surrounding area. The drying up of these waters would have had a significant impact on the local population and their livestock.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, is known in the Bible for its wickedness and its remarkable repentance following Jonah's preaching.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Nineveh was the capital city of the ancient Assyrian Empire, located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq. It is first mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities founded by Nimrod, along with Rehoboth-Ir (Gen. 10:11-12). Nineveh became the capital of Assyria during the reign of Sennacherib (c. 705-681 BC) and was known for its size, power, and splendor (Jonah 3:3; 4:11). ¶In the book of Jonah, Nineveh is portrayed as a city of great wickedness, whose evil had come to God's attention (Jonah 1:2). Jonah was sent to preach against Nineveh, warning of its impending destruction. To Jonah's surprise, the people of Nineveh, from the king to the lowliest citizen, repented in response to his message (Jonah 3:5-9). As a result, God relented and spared the city (Jonah 3:10). ¶Despite this remarkable event, Nineveh remained a symbol of Assyrian power and a threat to Israel and Judah. The prophets Nahum and Zephaniah both foretold the eventual destruction of Nineveh as a judgment against Assyria's wickedness and oppression (Nah. 1:1; 2:8; 3:7; Zeph. 2:13). Nineveh fell to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 BC, marking the end of the Assyrian Empire. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the repentance of the Ninevites as a rebuke to his unbelieving generation (Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:30, 32).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Nob was a city of priests near Jerusalem, known for a massacre ordered by King Saul and as a temporary location of the Ark of the Covenant.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Nob was a city of priests located near Jerusalem, possibly between the city and Anathoth (1 Sam. 21:1; 22:9, 11, 19; Neh. 11:32; Isa. 10:32). It is most notable as the site where King Saul ordered the massacre of the priests who had assisted David when he was fleeing from Saul (1 Sam. 22:11-19). Ahimelech, the priest at Nob, had provided David with the sacred bread of the Presence and the sword of Goliath (1 Sam. 21:1-9). Nob was also one of the places where the Ark of the Covenant was kept for a time during its travels (2 Sam. 6:1). The exact location of Nob is uncertain, but it was likely situated on a hill north of Jerusalem, possibly at Ras el-Mesharif or another nearby site that afforded a view of the city.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Mount of Olives is a mountain ridge east of Jerusalem, known as the site of many significant events in the Bible, particularly in the life of Jesus.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Mount of Olives is a mountain ridge located east of Jerusalem, separated from the city by the Kidron Valley. It is mentioned frequently in the Bible, especially in connection with the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus often visited the Mount of Olives (Luke 21:37; 22:39; John 8:1), and it was the site of many significant events, including His triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:1; Mark 11:1; Luke 19:29, 37), His prophetic discourse about the destruction of Jerusalem and His second coming (Matt. 24:3; Mark 13:3), His agonizing prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matt. 26:30; Mark 14:26; Luke 22:39), and His ascension into heaven (Luke 24:50-51; Acts 1:12). ¶The Mount of Olives also held significance in the Old Testament. King David fled from Jerusalem via the Mount of Olives during Absalom's rebellion (2 Sam. 15:30). The prophet Zechariah foretold that the Messiah would stand on the Mount of Olives when He comes to establish His kingdom on earth (Zech. 14:4).</ext_description>

		<short_description>On, also known as Heliopolis, was an ancient Egyptian city mentioned in the Bible in connection with Joseph's life and prophetic references to Egypt.</short_description>
		<ext_description>On, also known as Heliopolis (Greek for &quot;City of the Sun&quot;), was an ancient Egyptian city located in the Nile Delta region, near modern-day Cairo. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in relation to the life of Joseph. Joseph married Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On (Gen. 41:45, 50; 46:20). This marriage was arranged by Pharaoh and likely served to integrate Joseph into Egyptian society and religious life. ¶The city of On was a center of worship for the sun god Ra and was known for its temples and religious institutions. In the prophetic books, On is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against Egypt (Ezek. 30:17). Some translations and ancient versions (such as the Septuagint) also reference On in Isaiah 19:18, where it is called the &quot;City of Destruction&quot; or &quot;City of the Sun,&quot; depending on the interpretation of the Hebrew text.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ono was a town in the territory of Benjamin, often mentioned together with Lod, and was the site of a proposed meeting between Nehemiah and his enemies.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ono was a town located in the territory of Benjamin, near Lod (1 Chr. 8:12; Ezra 2:33; Neh. 7:37; 11:35). It is mentioned in the context of the descendants of Benjamin who resettled the area after the Babylonian exile. Ono is also known for its association with Nehemiah's enemies, Sanballat and Geshem, who sought to lure him away from Jerusalem to the plain of Ono, likely to harm him (Neh. 6:2). Nehemiah, however, perceived their intentions and refused to meet with them. The exact location of Ono is uncertain, but it was probably situated in the western part of Benjamin, near the border with Judah.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ophel was a fortified area or hill in Jerusalem, located south of the temple mount. It is mentioned in connection with the construction and repair of Jerusalem's walls during the reigns of Jotham (2 Chr. 27:3) and Manasseh (2 Chr. 33:14). During the time of Nehemiah, the Ophel was inhabited by the temple servants, known as the Nethinim (Neh. 3:26; 11:21). The wall of the Ophel was repaired by the Nethinim and other workers during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's defenses under Nehemiah (Neh. 3:27). The Ophel likely served as a strategic and defensive area, protecting the temple complex and the southern part of the city.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ophir was a region famous for its high-quality gold, which was imported to Israel during the reigns of David and Solomon.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ophir was a region known for its abundant and fine gold, which was highly prized in ancient times. It is mentioned in connection with the wealth and splendor of King Solomon, who received gold from Ophir through his naval expeditions in partnership with Hiram, king of Tyre (1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:11; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10). The gold of Ophir was renowned for its purity and value, and it was used in the construction and decoration of the temple and royal palaces (1 Chr. 29:4; 2 Chr. 8:18). The location of Ophir is uncertain, but scholars have proposed various possibilities, including the Arabian Peninsula, the Horn of Africa, and India. In poetic and prophetic texts, Ophir is used as a symbol of wealth and prosperity (Job 22:24; 28:16; Ps. 45:9; Isa. 13:12).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Paddan, also known as Paddan-aram or Aram, was the homeland of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, located in Mesopotamia.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Paddan, also referred to as Paddan-aram or Aram, was a region in Mesopotamia that played a significant role in the lives of the biblical patriarchs. It was the homeland of Abraham's family, and the place where Isaac and Jacob found their wives (Gen. 25:20; 28:2, 5-7). The name &quot;Paddan-aram&quot; means &quot;the plain of Aram&quot; or &quot;the field of Aram,&quot; referring to the area's geographical characteristics and its association with the Arameans. ¶Rebekah, Isaac's wife, was from Paddan-aram (Gen. 25:20). Later, Jacob fled to Paddan-aram to escape his brother Esau's anger and to find a wife from among his relatives (Gen. 28:2, 5-7). During his time there, Jacob married Leah and Rachel and fathered eleven of his twelve sons (Gen. 35:23-26). Jacob eventually left Paddan-aram to return to Canaan with his family and possessions (Gen. 31:18; 33:18). ¶The Arameans, who inhabited Paddan-aram, are mentioned as the ancestors of the Israelites in the context of God's deliverance and blessing (Deut. 26:5). The prophet Hosea also refers to Jacob's flight to Paddan-aram and his service for a wife (Hos. 12:12).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pamphylia was a Roman province on the southern coast of Asia Minor, visited by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journeys.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pamphylia was a Roman province located on the southern coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is mentioned several times in the New Testament, particularly in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. On the day of Pentecost, Jews from Pamphylia were among those present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:10). ¶During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas traveled to Perga in Pamphylia, where John Mark left them to return to Jerusalem (Acts 13:13). Later, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pamphylia again on their way to Antioch (Acts 14:24). In his second missionary journey, Paul chose not to take John Mark with him because he had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia (Acts 15:38). ¶The province of Pamphylia was known for its coastal cities, such as Perga and Attalia (modern-day Antalya), which served as important centers for trade and commerce. The region was also known for its rugged terrain, with the Taurus Mountains running through the northern part of the province.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Paphos was a city on the island of Cyprus, where Paul and Barnabas encountered a sorcerer and converted the proconsul to Christianity.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Paphos was a city located on the southwestern coast of the island of Cyprus. It served as the capital of the island during the Roman period and was known for its temple dedicated to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. In the New Testament, Paphos is mentioned in connection with Paul's first missionary journey (Acts 13:6-13). ¶When Paul and Barnabas arrived in Paphos, they encountered a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-7). The proconsul, an intelligent man, summoned Paul and Barnabas and sought to hear the word of God. However, the sorcerer, also known as Elymas, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith (Acts 13:8). ¶Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked Elymas and temporarily blinded him, demonstrating the power of God (Acts 13:9-11). As a result, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord (Acts 13:12). After this incident, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and traveled to Perga in Pamphylia (Acts 13:13).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Paran was a desert region in the Sinai Peninsula, associated with the Israelites' wanderings and the early life of Ishmael.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Paran was a desert region located in the Sinai Peninsula, south of Canaan. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in connection with the Israelites' wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar, grew up in the wilderness of Paran after being sent away with his mother (Gen. 21:21). During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, they camped in the wilderness of Paran after leaving the wilderness of Sinai (Num. 10:12; 12:16). It was from Paran that Moses sent the twelve spies to explore the land of Canaan (Num. 13:3, 26). ¶The wilderness of Paran was also associated with King David. After the death of Samuel, David went down to the wilderness of Paran (1 Sam. 25:1). Later, when Hadad the Edomite fled from King Solomon, he passed through Paran on his way to Egypt (1 Kgs. 11:18). ¶The exact boundaries of the wilderness of Paran are not clearly defined in the Bible, but it appears to have been a vast desert region in the central and northeastern parts of the Sinai Peninsula, bordered by the wilderness of Zin to the north and the Gulf of Aqaba to the south.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Paran is mentioned in poetic passages as a place from which God comes or shines forth.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Paran is mentioned in two poetic passages in the Old Testament (Deut. 33:2; Hab. 3:3). In both instances, it is associated with the appearance or manifestation of God. In the blessing of Moses, God is described as coming from Sinai, rising from Seir, and shining forth from Mount Paran (Deut. 33:2). Similarly, in Habakkuk's prayer, God is portrayed as coming from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran (Hab. 3:3). ¶The exact location of Mount Paran is uncertain, and there is no clear geographical reference to a specific mountain by this name. It is possible that &quot;Mount Paran&quot; is used symbolically or poetically to represent the general region of Paran, emphasizing God's presence and power as He led the Israelites through the wilderness. Some scholars suggest that Mount Paran might be another name for Mount Sinai or a mountain range in the vicinity of the wilderness of Paran.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Parbar, meaning &quot;colonnade&quot; or &quot;portico,&quot; was a structure mentioned in connection with the organization of the Levites and their duties in the temple during the reign of King David (1 Chr. 26:18). It was located on the west side of the temple complex in Jerusalem. The Levites were assigned to guard the gates and entrances of the temple, including the gate of Shallecheth, which led to the Parbar. ¶The exact nature and purpose of the Parbar are not described in detail in the Bible. It may have been a colonnade or a series of chambers used for storage or other functions related to the temple service. Some scholars suggest that the Parbar might have been a part of the temple complex added during the reign of Solomon or later kings. However, due to the limited information provided in the biblical text, the precise structure and role of the Parbar remain uncertain.</ext_description>

The exact location of Parvaim is unknown, and there are no other biblical references to this place.

Others propose that Parvaim might be a variant of Sepharvaim, a place mentioned in the Syriac and Targum Jonathan versions of Genesis 10:30. However, due to the lack of additional information in the biblical text and other historical sources, the identification of Parvaim remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pathros was a region located in Upper Egypt, the southern part of the country. It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of Judean refugees who fled to Egypt after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (Jer. 44:1, 15). The name &quot;Pathros&quot; is derived from the Egyptian word &quot;p-t-rsy,&quot; meaning &quot;the southern land.&quot; In Isaiah 11:11, Pathros is listed among the places from which God will recover the remnant of His people. Ezekiel prophesied that God would bring judgment upon Egypt and make the land of Pathros a desolation (Ezek. 29:14; 30:14). The biblical references to Pathros indicate that it was a distinct region within Egypt and that it had a significant Judean population during the exilic and post-exilic periods.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Patmos is a small Greek island located in the Aegean Sea, approximately 37 miles southwest of Miletus. It is mentioned in the New Testament in Revelation 1:9, where the apostle John states that he was on the island of Patmos &quot;because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.&quot; According to early Christian tradition, John was exiled to Patmos during the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (AD 81-96) because of his faith and preaching. While on Patmos, John received a series of visions from God, which he recorded in the Book of Revelation. These visions include messages to the seven churches of Asia Minor, prophetic imagery, and a glimpse of the heavenly throne room. The island of Patmos has since become a place of pilgrimage for Christians, with several monasteries and churches commemorating John's exile and the writing of Revelation.</ext_description>

It is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel as part of a prophecy against Egypt (Ezek. 30:15-16). Ezekiel foretells that God will pour out His wrath upon Sin (Pelusium) and cut off the multitude of No (Thebes), indicating that Pelusium would face divine judgment along with other major Egyptian cities. Historically, Pelusium served as a strategic frontier fortress and was known for its role in defending Egypt against foreign invasions. The city was also an important commercial center, situated at the crossroads of trade routes between Egypt, the Levant, and the Mediterranean world. Although the biblical references to Pelusium are limited, its inclusion in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights its significance in ancient Egypt.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Peniel, also called Penuel, was the place where Jacob wrestled with God and had his name changed to Israel.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Peniel, also known as Penuel, was a significant location in the life of the patriarch Jacob. It is first mentioned in Genesis 32:30-31, where Jacob wrestled with a mysterious man (believed to be God or an angel) throughout the night. After the encounter, Jacob named the place Peniel, meaning &quot;face of God,&quot; saying, &quot;I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.&quot; The wrestling match marked a turning point in Jacob's life, as he received a new name, Israel, signifying his struggle with God and men (Gen. 32:28). ¶Later in the Bible, Penuel is mentioned as a city in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River. During the time of the judges, Gideon and his men pursued the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna to Penuel (Judg. 8:8-9). The men of Penuel refused to provide bread to Gideon's army, so Gideon vowed to tear down the tower of Penuel upon his return (Judg. 8:17). In the reign of King Jeroboam I of Israel, Penuel was one of the cities he fortified (1 Kgs. 12:25), possibly to secure his kingdom against the threat of Judah in the south.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The People's Gate was one of the gates of Jerusalem, where the prophet Jeremiah was instructed to proclaim God's message.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The People's Gate, mentioned in Jeremiah 17:19, was one of the gates of Jerusalem during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The Lord instructed Jeremiah to stand in the People's Gate and proclaim a message to the kings of Judah and all the people who entered through that gate. The message emphasized the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy and refraining from work on that day. The exact location of the People's Gate is not specified in the biblical text, but it was likely one of the main entrances to the city, where people from various walks of life would pass through. The gate's name suggests that it was a popular and well-frequented access point to Jerusalem. Jeremiah's proclamation at the People's Gate underscores the prophetic call to obedience and the centrality of the Sabbath in the religious life of Judah.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Peor was a mountain in Moab where Balak brought Balaam to curse Israel, and where the Israelites later engaged in idolatry and immorality with the Moabites.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Peor was a mountain located in the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned in the context of Balak, the king of Moab, who sought to curse Israel through the prophet Balaam (Num. 23:28). Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, hoping that from there, Balaam would be able to curse the Israelites. However, God intervened and caused Balaam to bless Israel instead (Num. 23:29-24:9). ¶Later, when the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, they began to engage in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites (Num. 25:1-3). This incident became known as the &quot;matter of Peor&quot; (Num. 25:18; 31:16) and resulted in a plague that killed 24,000 Israelites (Num. 25:9). The Israelites' sin at Peor was remembered as a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of idolatry and foreign influences (Josh. 22:17; Ps. 106:28-29). The events at Peor highlight the importance of remaining faithful to God and resisting the temptations of surrounding pagan cultures.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Mount Perazim was the location where David, with God's help, defeated the Philistines, and it is used by Isaiah as an example of God's judgment.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Mount Perazim is mentioned in Isaiah 28:21 as a place where the Lord will rise up and do His &quot;strange work&quot; and &quot;alien task,&quot; referring to His judgment against the wicked. The name &quot;Perazim&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;perez,&quot; meaning &quot;to break through&quot; or &quot;to burst forth.&quot; The reference to Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy alludes to David's victory over the Philistines at Baal-perazim (2 Sam. 5:20; 1 Chr. 14:11). In that battle, David acknowledged that the Lord had broken through his enemies like a bursting flood, hence the name &quot;Baal-perazim,&quot; meaning &quot;Lord of the bursting forth.&quot; ¶By using Mount Perazim as an example, Isaiah emphasizes that just as God granted David victory over the Philistines, He will also bring judgment upon those who oppose Him. The prophet warns that God's judgment will be swift and decisive, like His intervention on behalf of David. The mention of Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy serves as a reminder of God's power and His willingness to act on behalf of His people while also bringing judgment upon the wicked.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Perez-uzza, meaning &quot;the breach of Uzzah,&quot; was the name given to the place where Uzzah, one of the men accompanying the Ark of the Covenant, was struck down by God (1 Chr. 13:11). During the reign of King David, the Ark was being transported from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem on a new cart. When the oxen stumbled near the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark, touching it in the process. As a result, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down for his irreverence (1 Chr. 13:9-10). ¶David was both afraid and angry because of this incident, and he named the place Perez-uzza. The event caused David to fear the Lord and question how he could bring the Ark to Jerusalem (1 Chr. 13:12). The Ark was then taken to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, where it remained for three months, bringing blessings to Obed-edom's household (1 Chr. 13:13-14). ¶The incident at Perez-uzza highlights the sacredness of the Ark of the Covenant and the importance of handling holy objects with reverence and according to divine instructions. It also demonstrates God's holiness and the consequences of irreverence or disobedience.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Perga was an ancient city located in the region of Pamphylia, on the southern coast of modern-day Turkey. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's first missionary journey (Acts 13:13-14; 14:25). Paul and Barnabas, along with John Mark, sailed from Paphos on the island of Cyprus to Perga in Pamphylia. Upon arriving in Perga, John Mark left the group and returned to Jerusalem (Acts 13:13). Paul and Barnabas then traveled north to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue (Acts 13:14). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Perga again, preaching the gospel to the city before sailing back to Antioch in Syria (Acts 14:25). Although the biblical account does not provide extensive details about their ministry in Perga, it is clear that the city was an important stop on Paul's missionary itinerary and played a role in the spread of Christianity in the region.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pergamum, also known as Pergamon, was an ancient city located in the region of Mysia in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is one of the seven churches mentioned in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:11; 2:12). In the letter to the church in Pergamum, the risen Christ commends the believers for holding fast to His name and not denying their faith, even in the face of martyrdom (Rev. 2:13). However, Christ also rebukes them for tolerating some who held to the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, which involved idolatry and sexual immorality (Rev. 2:14-15). Pergamum is described as the place where &quot;Satan's throne&quot; is located (Rev. 2:13), possibly referring to the city's numerous pagan temples and its status as a center of emperor worship. Despite the challenges and temptations they faced, the Christians in Pergamum are encouraged to repent and remain faithful, with the promise of receiving hidden manna and a new name (Rev. 2:16-17).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Persia was the empire that conquered Babylon and allowed the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Persia, also known as the Achaemenid Empire, was a major world power that ruled over a vast territory from the 6th to the 4th centuries BC. In the Bible, Persia is mentioned in the context of the Jewish exile and the subsequent return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Empire, which had destroyed Jerusalem and taken the Jews into captivity, fell to the Persians under Cyrus the Great (2 Chr. 36:20, 22-23; Ezra 1:1-2). Cyrus issued a decree allowing the exiled Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-4). The Persian kings Darius I and Artaxerxes I also played significant roles in supporting the rebuilding efforts (Ezra 4:24; 6:14). ¶The book of Esther is set in the Persian capital of Susa during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), and it describes how Esther, a Jewish woman, became queen and saved her people from a plot to destroy them (Esther 1:3, 14, 18; 10:2). The prophets Ezekiel and Daniel also mention Persia in their visions and prophecies (Ezek. 27:10; 38:5; Dan. 8:20; 10:1, 13, 20; 11:2). Persia is portrayed as a powerful empire that God used to fulfill His purposes for His people, even though the Persians themselves were not followers of the God of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pethor was a city in Mesopotamia, located near the Euphrates River, and is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of Balaam, the prophet hired by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the Israelites (Num. 22:5; Deut. 23:4). When the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, Balak sent messengers to Pethor to summon Balaam, offering him payment to curse Israel (Num. 22:5-7). Despite God's initial warning not to go with the men, Balaam eventually set out on his donkey to meet with Balak (Num. 22:21). Along the way, the Angel of the Lord opposed Balaam, and his donkey spoke to him, revealing the presence of the Angel (Num. 22:22-35). Balaam ultimately blessed Israel instead of cursing them, following God's command (Num. 23-24). The location of Pethor is not precisely known, but its association with the Euphrates River suggests that it was situated in the upper Mesopotamian region, possibly in the area of modern-day Syria or Iraq.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pharpar, along with the Abana (or Amana), was one of the two rivers of Damascus mentioned in the Bible (2 Kgs. 5:12). When Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, sought healing from his leprosy, the prophet Elisha instructed him to wash seven times in the Jordan River (2 Kgs. 5:10). Naaman was initially angry at this suggestion, exclaiming, &quot;Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?&quot; (2 Kgs. 5:12). However, after being persuaded by his servants, Naaman followed Elisha's instructions and was healed of his leprosy (2 Kgs. 5:13-14). The Pharpar River, which still exists today, flows from the Anti-Lebanon mountains and runs through the city of Damascus before emptying into a lake east of the city. Naaman's initial reluctance to wash in the Jordan highlights the pride and prejudice that can hinder people from experiencing God's healing and blessing.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Philippi was a city in Macedonia where Paul founded a church and experienced persecution, imprisonment, and a miraculous deliverance.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Philippi was a prominent city in the region of Macedonia (modern-day Greece) and played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity. The city is first mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's second missionary journey (Acts 16:12). In Philippi, Paul and his companions met a group of women praying by the river, including Lydia, a merchant who became the first convert in Europe (Acts 16:13-15). However, Paul and Silas were soon imprisoned after casting out a spirit of divination from a slave girl (Acts 16:16-24). While in prison, they experienced a miraculous earthquake that led to the conversion of the jailer and his household (Acts 16:25-34). ¶Paul visited Philippi again on his third missionary journey (Acts 20:6) and later wrote a letter to the church, known as the Epistle to the Philippians. In this letter, Paul expresses his deep affection for the Philippian believers and thanks them for their support and partnership in the gospel (Phil. 1:3-7; 4:15-19). He also encourages them to remain united, humble, and joyful in the face of adversity (Phil. 1:27-2:18; 4:4-7). The church in Philippi is portrayed as a faithful and generous community, supporting Paul's ministry even in his imprisonment (Phil. 4:10-20).</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Philistines were a powerful people who inhabited the coastal plain of Canaan and were often in conflict with the Israelites during the period of the judges and early monarchy.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Philistines were an ancient people who lived in the coastal plain of Canaan, primarily in the region known as Philistia, which corresponds to the modern-day Gaza Strip and the southern coast of Israel. They are first mentioned in the Bible during the time of Abraham (Gen. 21:32, 34) and Isaac (Gen. 26:1, 8, 14-15, 18). The Philistines were not part of the original inhabitants of Canaan and are believed to have migrated from the Aegean region, possibly as part of the Sea Peoples' movement in the 12th century BC. ¶Throughout the period of the judges and the early monarchy, the Philistines were a constant threat to the Israelites. They oppressed Israel for 40 years until Samson began to deliver them (Judg. 13:1, 5). Samson's encounters with the Philistines, including his marriage to a Philistine woman and his final act of bringing down the temple of Dagon, are recorded in Judges 14-16. During the time of Samuel, the Philistines defeated Israel and captured the Ark of the Covenant (1 Sam. 4). They were later forced to return the Ark after experiencing plagues (1 Sam. 5-6). ¶The Philistines continued to be a significant enemy during the reigns of Saul and David. The famous battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath took place during this time (1 Sam. 17). David fought against the Philistines throughout his reign (2 Sam. 5; 8:1, 12; 21; 23), and they remained a threat until the later years of the divided monarchy (2 Kgs. 18:8; 2 Chr. 26:6-7; 28:18). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Zephaniah all mention the Philistines in their oracles, often pronouncing judgment against them (Isa. 14:29-31; Jer. 47; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:8; Zeph. 2:5). ¶The Philistines were known for their advanced iron technology, their distinctive pottery, and their religious practices, which included the worship of deities such as Dagon, Ashtoreth, and Baal-Zebub. The biblical narrative portrays them as a formidable enemy of Israel, but also as a people whom God used to test and discipline His chosen nation.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Phoenicia was an ancient region and civilization located along the Mediterranean coast, primarily in modern-day Lebanon and parts of Syria and Israel. The Phoenicians were known for their maritime skills, extensive trade networks, and their development of the alphabet. In the New Testament, Phoenicia is mentioned in the context of the early spread of Christianity. After the persecution that arose following Stephen's death, some believers traveled as far as Phoenicia, preaching the gospel (Acts 11:19). Later, when Paul and Barnabas were returning from the Jerusalem Council, they passed through Phoenicia, bringing joy to the believers there (Acts 15:3). During Paul's final journey to Jerusalem, he sailed to Tyre, a city in Phoenicia, where he stayed with disciples for seven days (Acts 21:2-4). Although the Phoenicians are not mentioned extensively in the Bible, their region played a role in the spread of the gospel in the early church era.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Phoenix, also known as Phoenice, was a harbor on the southern coast of the island of Crete, mentioned in the account of Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:12). During the voyage, the ship encountered a severe storm, and the crew debated whether to stay at the port of Fair Havens or sail to Phoenix to spend the winter (Acts 27:8-12). The majority decided to attempt the journey to Phoenix, as it was considered a more suitable harbor to winter in (Acts 27:12). However, before they could reach Phoenix, a violent wind drove the ship off course, ultimately leading to its shipwreck on the island of Malta (Acts 27:13-44). The exact location of Phoenix is not certain, but it is believed to have been situated on the southwestern coast of Crete, possibly near the modern-day town of Loutro or the village of Phiniki.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Phrygia was a region in Asia Minor where Paul traveled and preached the gospel, and some of its inhabitants were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Phrygia was an ancient region located in the central part of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). In the New Testament, Phrygia is mentioned in connection with the spread of the gospel and the missionary journeys of Paul. On the day of Pentecost, people from Phrygia were among those present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:10). During Paul's second missionary journey, he and his companions traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, where they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in the province of Asia (Acts 16:6). On his third missionary journey, Paul passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia again, strengthening the disciples (Acts 18:23). In the closing of Paul's first letter to Timothy, he mentions that some have wandered from the faith, including Phygelus and Hermogenes, who were likely from Phrygia (2 Tim. 1:15). The mention of Phrygia in these passages highlights the spread of Christianity beyond Judea and the importance of the region in the early church's growth.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pi-beseth was an Egyptian city that Ezekiel prophesied would experience God's judgment along with other cities in Egypt.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pi-beseth, also known as Bubastis, was an ancient Egyptian city located in the eastern Nile Delta. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Ezekiel's prophecy against Egypt (Ezek. 30:17). In this prophecy, Ezekiel declares that the young men of Aven (or On, another name for Heliopolis) and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity. This judgment is part of a larger oracle against Egypt, in which God declares that He will bring punishment upon the land for its idolatry and opposition to His people. The mention of Pi-beseth alongside other prominent Egyptian cities underscores the severity and scope of the divine judgment that Ezekiel prophesied would come upon the nation.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pi-hahiroth was a location near the Red Sea where the Israelites camped before crossing the sea during the Exodus from Egypt.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pi-hahiroth, also known as Hahiroth, was a place mentioned in the account of the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt. After leaving Succoth, the Israelites were instructed by God to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal-zephon (Exod. 14:2). The Egyptians, led by Pharaoh, pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they were camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon (Exod. 14:9). It was at this location that God instructed Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea, causing the waters to divide and allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground (Exod. 14:15-16, 21-22). The Egyptians pursued them into the sea, but God brought the waters back upon them, drowning Pharaoh's entire army (Exod. 14:23-28). The Israelites' journey from Pi-hahiroth is also mentioned in the list of their encampments in Numbers 33:7-8. The exact location of Pi-hahiroth is uncertain, but it was evidently near the Red Sea, and its mention in the Exodus narrative highlights God's power and deliverance on behalf of His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pirathon was a town in the hill country of Ephraim, associated with the judge Abdon and two of David's mighty men, Benaiah and Hiddai.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pirathon was a town located in the hill country of Ephraim, in the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim. It is mentioned in the Bible as the hometown of several notable Israelites. Abdon, one of the judges of Israel, was from Pirathon (Judg. 12:13, 15). He judged Israel for eight years and was buried in Pirathon (Judg. 12:14-15). Two of David's mighty men, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Hiddai (or Hurai) of the brooks of Gaash, were also from Pirathon (2 Sam. 23:30; 1 Chr. 11:31; 27:14). Benaiah, in particular, was a highly esteemed warrior who commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites, and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne (2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kgs. 1:8, 38, 44). The repeated mention of Pirathon as the hometown of these significant figures suggests that it was a place of some importance during the period of the judges and the early monarchy.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pisgah, or the slopes of Pisgah, was a mountain range in Moab where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pisgah, or the slopes of Pisgah, was a mountain range located in the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned several times in the Pentateuch, particularly in relation to Moses and the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, they camped in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Moab, where Moses delivered his final instructions and warnings to the people (Deut. 4:44-46). God instructed Moses to go up to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, and view the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites (Deut. 3:27; 34:1). From this vantage point, Moses was able to see the Promised Land, from Gilead to Dan, and all the lands of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, Judah, and the Negev (Deut. 34:1-3). After viewing the land, Moses died there in the land of Moab, and God buried him in a valley opposite Beth-peor (Deut. 34:5-6). The slopes of Pisgah are also mentioned as part of the territory conquered by the Israelites and allocated to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Num. 21:20; Josh. 12:3; 13:20). The significance of Pisgah lies in its association with Moses' final moments and its panoramic view of the Promised Land, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promise to His people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Pishon was one of the four rivers that flowed from the river in the Garden of Eden, encircling the land of Havilah, which was known for its gold, bdellium, and onyx.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Pishon is one of the four rivers mentioned in the biblical account of the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:11). The Bible describes a single river flowing out of Eden to water the garden, which then divided into four rivers, with Pishon being the first. Pishon is said to wind through the entire land of Havilah, a region known for its abundance of gold, bdellium (a fragrant resin), and onyx stone (Gen. 2:11-12). The name &quot;Pishon&quot; is thought to derive from the Hebrew root &quot;puwsh,&quot; meaning &quot;to scatter, spread, or spring forward,&quot; possibly indicating that the river originated from a spring and formed a delta. Despite attempts to identify Pishon with various modern-day rivers, such as the Nile, Indus, or Ganges, its exact location remains unknown, as the geography described in the Eden account is difficult to reconcile with the current landscape. Some scholars suggest that the Pishon and the other rivers of Eden may have symbolic or allegorical significance, representing the life-giving power and abundance that flowed from God's presence in the garden.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pisidia was an ancient region located in the central part of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), north of Pamphylia and Lycia. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's first missionary journey (Acts 13:14; 14:24). Paul and Barnabas traveled to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 13:14-41). Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, but the jealous Jewish leaders stirred up persecution against them, forcing them to leave the city (Acts 13:42-52). Despite the opposition, the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region (Acts 13:49). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pisidia again, strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain faithful (Acts 14:21-23). The mention of Pisidia in the book of Acts highlights the spread of the gospel in Asia Minor and the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pithom was one of the store cities built by the Israelites during their time of slavery in Egypt (Exod. 1:11). The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war (Exod. 1:9-10). The exact location of Pithom is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the modern-day city of Tell el-Maskhuta. The name &quot;Pithom&quot; is thought to be derived from the Egyptian &quot;Per-Atum,&quot; meaning &quot;House of Atum,&quot; referring to the Egyptian god Atum. The mention of Pithom in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Pontus was an ancient region located in the northeastern part of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), bordering the Black Sea. It is mentioned in the New Testament as a place where Jewish inhabitants were present (Acts 2:9; 18:2) and where early Christian communities were established (1 Pet. 1:1). On the day of Pentecost, Jews from Pontus were among those who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:9). Aquila, a Jew from Pontus, and his wife Priscilla, were tentmakers who had been expelled from Rome by Emperor Claudius and met Paul in Corinth (Acts 18:2). They became close friends and co-workers of Paul, hosting a church in their home (1 Cor. 16:19). The apostle Peter addressed his first epistle to the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus and other regions of Asia Minor (1 Pet. 1:1), indicating the presence of Christian believers in the area. The mention of Pontus in the New Testament reveals the spread of the gospel and the establishment of Christian communities in various parts of the Roman Empire.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Potsherd Gate, also known as the Harsith Gate, was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the book of Jeremiah (Jer. 19:2). The Lord instructed Jeremiah to go to the Potsherd Gate, which was near the entrance of the Valley of Ben Hinnom (or Gehenna), and proclaim a message of judgment against the people of Judah (Jer. 19:1-2). The Valley of Ben Hinnom was notorious for the practice of child sacrifice to the pagan god Molech (Jer. 32:35). Jeremiah was told to shatter an earthenware jar in front of the elders and priests as a symbol of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and its people (Jer. 19:10-11). The Potsherd Gate likely received its name from the fragments of broken pottery (potsherds) that were discarded in the nearby valley. The gate's location near the Valley of Ben Hinnom, a place associated with idolatry and judgment, underscores the severity of Jeremiah's prophetic message and the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness to God.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Punon was a stopping place for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, mentioned only in the list of encampments in Numbers 33. The Israelites arrived at Punon after departing from Zalmonah and before moving on to Oboth (Num. 33:42-43). The exact location of Punon is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Edom, east of the Jordan River. According to the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus and early Christian scholars Eusebius and Jerome, Punon was identified with Phaeno (or Phinon), a site known for its copper mines and located between the ancient cities of Petra and Zoar. However, this identification remains speculative due to the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence. The biblical record does not provide any details about the events that occurred during the Israelites' stay at Punon, but its inclusion in the itinerary highlights the numerous stages and challenges the Israelites faced during their 40-year journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Puteoli, modern-day Pozzuoli, was an important port city located on the Bay of Naples in Italy. It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 28:13). After sailing from Malta, where they had been shipwrecked, Paul and his companions arrived at Syracuse and then proceeded to Rhegium. From there, they sailed to Puteoli, where they found some Christian brothers and stayed with them for seven days (Acts 28:13-14). Puteoli was a significant harbor and commercial center, serving as a gateway to Rome. It was also a major hub for the grain trade from Egypt, which was vital for supplying food to the populous city of Rome. The presence of a Christian community in Puteoli indicates the spread of the gospel in Italy, even before Paul's arrival in Rome. Paul's stay in Puteoli for a week suggests that he had the opportunity to fellowship with and encourage the local believers before continuing his journey to Rome, where he would await trial before Caesar.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Raamah is mentioned in the Bible as one of the trading partners of the city of Tyre, along with Sheba (Ezek. 27:22). The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with Tyre, supplying them with the best of all kinds of spices, precious stones, and gold (Ezek. 27:22). The exact location of Raamah is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been situated in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, possibly in the region of modern-day Yemen. This identification is based on the association of Raamah with Sheba, a kingdom known for its wealth and located in the southern Arabian Peninsula. The reference to Raamah in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre, which included distant lands such as Arabia. The precious commodities mentioned—spices, gems, and gold—were highly valued in the ancient world and contributed to Tyre's prosperity and reputation as a major commercial center.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Raamses was one of the store cities built by the Israelites during their enslavement in Egypt, along with Pithom.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Raamses, also known as Rameses, was one of the store cities built by the Israelites during their time of slavery in Egypt (Exod. 1:11). The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war (Exod. 1:9-10). The exact location of Raamses is debated, but it is generally associated with the city of Pi-Ramesses (House of Ramesses), the capital of Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC. Pi-Ramesses was located in the eastern Nile Delta, near the modern-day city of Qantir. The name &quot;Raamses&quot; is thought to be derived from the name of Pharaoh Ramesses II, who was known for his extensive building projects. The mention of Raamses in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Rabbith was a town located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua (Josh. 19:20). It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the cities and towns that were assigned to Issachar as part of their inheritance (Josh. 19:17-23). The exact location of Rabbith is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of the Jezreel Valley, which was known for its fertile land and strategic importance. The Jezreel Valley was a major trade route and a key agricultural area in ancient Israel. The mention of Rabbith in the list of Issachar's towns highlights the allocation of specific territories to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance. Although little is known about Rabbith beyond its name and general location, its inclusion in the biblical record serves to emphasize the orderly division of the land and the establishment of the tribes in their designated areas.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Tiberias (Rakkath), a city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, near where Jesus fed the five thousand (Josh. 19:35; John 6:23).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Tiberias, also known as Rakkath in the Old Testament (Josh. 19:35), was a city located on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. It was founded around 20 AD by Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great, and named after the Roman emperor Tiberius. Tiberias served as the capital of Galilee during the time of Jesus and is mentioned in the context of the feeding of the five thousand (John 6:23). After this miracle, Jesus and his disciples crossed the Sea of Galilee, and boats from Tiberias followed them. Although Tiberias is not directly mentioned in connection with Jesus' ministry, it is likely that he visited the city or passed through the region. In later centuries, Tiberias became a center of Jewish learning and the site where the Mishnah and the Jerusalem Talmud were compiled.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ramah was a town in the territory of Benjamin, often associated with significant events in Israel's history, such as the mourning of Rachel and the imprisonment of Jeremiah.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ramah was a town located in the tribal territory of Benjamin, near Gibeah and Jerusalem. It is mentioned several times in the Bible in connection with various events and prophecies. During the period of the judges, Deborah, a prophetess and judge, held court between Ramah and Bethel (Judg. 4:5). In the story of the Levite and his concubine, the Levite planned to spend the night in Ramah before the tragic events in Gibeah (Judg. 19:13). Later, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, he fortified Ramah to prevent people from going to or coming from Judah (1 Kgs. 15:17, 21-22; 2 Chr. 16:1, 5-6). The town was also mentioned in the context of the return of the exiles from Babylon (Ezra 2:26; Neh. 7:30) and as one of the settlements where the Benjamites lived after the exile (Neh. 11:33). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea mentioned Ramah in their prophecies, often in connection with judgment or mourning (Isa. 10:29; Jer. 31:15; 40:1; Hos. 5:8). In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel quotes Jeremiah's prophecy about Rachel weeping for her children in Ramah, applying it to Herod's massacre of the infants in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:18). The frequent mention of Ramah in various contexts highlights its importance as a town in the territory of Benjamin and its association with significant events in Israel's history.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ramah is mentioned in the Bible as a town situated on the border between the territory of the tribe of Asher and the city-state of Tyre (Josh. 19:29). It is listed among the towns and cities allocated to Asher during the division of the Promised Land. The exact location of this Ramah is uncertain, but it is believed to have been located in the northern coastal region of Canaan, near the Mediterranean Sea. Its proximity to Tyre, a major Phoenician city known for its maritime trade and wealth, suggests that Ramah may have been influenced by or involved in commercial activities with the Phoenicians. The mention of Ramah in the description of Asher's territory highlights the allocation of specific towns and cities to each of the twelve tribes of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

		<short_description>Ramath-lehi, meaning &quot;hill of the jawbone,&quot; was the place where Samson killed a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ramath-lehi is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the story of Samson, one of the judges of Israel (Judg. 15:17). After Samson's wife was given to another man, he took revenge on the Philistines by burning their crops and vineyards. In retaliation, the Philistines came to arrest Samson, who was staying in Judah. The men of Judah, fearing Philistine reprisal, bound Samson and handed him over to the Philistines. However, when the Philistines came to capture him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he broke free from his bonds. He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and used it to strike down a thousand Philistines (Judg. 15:14-16). The place where this event occurred was called Ramath-lehi, which means &quot;hill of the jawbone&quot; or &quot;jawbone height&quot; (Judg. 15:17). The name served as a reminder of Samson's remarkable feat and God's empowerment in his life. The story of Samson at Ramath-lehi highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during the period of the judges and demonstrates God's power to deliver His people through unlikely means.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Rameses was a city and region in Egypt where Jacob's family settled when they first arrived in Egypt (Gen. 47:11). It was located in the land of Goshen. The Israelites later departed from Rameses at the beginning of the Exodus (Exo. 12:37; Num. 33:3,5). The name may come from the Egyptian phrase &quot;Ra created it&quot;, referring to the sun god Ra. Some scholars believe Rameses was named after the pharaoh Rameses II of the 19th Dynasty, but the biblical chronology would place the Exodus much earlier. The exact location is uncertain, but it was likely in the eastern Nile Delta region.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ramoth, also called Ramoth-gilead, was a city of refuge in Gad and a Levitical city (Deu. 4:43; Jos. 20:8; 21:38).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ramoth, also known as Ramoth-gilead, Galeed, Ramah, Ramath-mizpeh, Mizpah, and Jegar-sahadutha, was an important city east of the Jordan River. It was designated as a city of refuge (Deu. 4:43; Jos. 20:8) and a Levitical city in the territory of Gad (Jos. 21:38; 1 Ch. 6:80). Ramoth-gilead was the site of several battles between Israel and Aram (1 Ki. 22; 2 Ki. 8-9; 2 Ch. 18; 22). It is also mentioned in the story of Jacob and Laban, who made a covenant there and named the place Galeed and Mizpah (Gen. 31:47-49). The exact location is uncertain, but it was likely an important fortress city in Gilead guarding a key trade route.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Red Sea was the body of water miraculously crossed by the Israelites in their escape from Egypt (Exo. 13:18; 15:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Red Sea is significant in the Bible as the sea the Israelites miraculously crossed during the Exodus from Egypt. God parted the waters, allowing Israel to cross on dry ground, but drowned the pursuing Egyptian army when the waters closed back over them (Exo. 14-15). This event is remembered as a great act of divine deliverance (Jos. 2:10; Neh. 9:9; Psa. 106:7-9; 136:13-15). The Red Sea also marked the southern border of the Promised Land (Exo. 23:31). King Solomon later built a fleet of ships on the Red Sea at Ezion-geber (1 Ki. 9:26). The Hebrew name Yam Suph means &quot;Sea of Reeds&quot;, so the body of water was likely one of the shallow lakes along Egypt's eastern border rather than the main body of the Red Sea. Its exact location is debated.</ext_description>

In one instance, David and his men were hiding in a cave near the Philistine camp in the Valley of Rephaim when three of his mighty men risked their lives to bring him water from the well at Bethlehem (2 Sa. 23:13; 1 Ch. 11:15). The valley is also mentioned figuratively in Isaiah 17:5, comparing the harvest of Israel to the gathering of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.</ext_description>

At Rephidim, the people complained about the lack of water, and Moses, following God's instructions, miraculously provided water by striking a rock with his staff (Exo. 17:1-7). The Amalekites also attacked the Israelites at Rephidim, but Israel, led by Joshua and aided by Moses' intercession, defeated them (Exo. 17:8-16). The exact location of Rephidim is uncertain, but it was likely in the central part of the Sinai Peninsula.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Riblah was a city in Hamath where the Babylonians set up their headquarters during their campaigns against Judah (2 Ki. 23:33; 25:6, 20-21; Jer. 39:5-6; 52:9-10, 26-27).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Riblah, located in the land of Hamath, was a city in ancient Syria where the Babylonians established their headquarters during their military campaigns against the kingdom of Judah. Pharaoh Necho of Egypt put Jehoahaz, king of Judah, in chains at Riblah (2 Ki. 23:33). Later, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, captured Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, and brought him to Riblah, where he executed Zedekiah's sons before his eyes and then blinded him (2 Ki. 25:6-7; Jer. 39:5-7; 52:9-11). The Babylonian army also brought other captured Judean officials to Riblah, where they were put to death (2 Ki. 25:20-21; Jer. 52:26-27). Riblah's location on the Orontes River made it a strategic base for military operations. The exact site is identified with modern-day Ribleh in Syria, about 35 miles northeast of Baalbek, Lebanon.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Rimmon, meaning &quot;pomegranate,&quot; was a rock or cliff where 600 Benjamite men fled after a battle with the other Israelite tribes. The conflict arose when the Benjamites refused to surrender the men of Gibeah who had committed a heinous crime (Jdg. 19-20). In the ensuing battle, the Benjamites were defeated, and the survivors escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months (Jdg. 20:45, 47). Later, the Israelites sent a peace delegation to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon, urging them to return (Jdg. 21:13). The exact location of the rock of Rimmon is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

When Saul and his men were about to close in on David and his followers, a messenger arrived informing Saul that the Philistines had invaded the land. Saul then broke off his pursuit of David to fight against the Philistines. As a result, the place was named the Rock of Escape or the Rock of Divisions (1 Sa. 23:28).

		<short_description>Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire, where Paul was imprisoned and wrote several epistles (Acts 28:16; Rom. 1:7).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Rome, the capital city of the Roman Empire, plays a significant role in the New Testament. It was the seat of power for the vast empire that ruled over much of the known world during the time of Jesus and the early church. Rome is mentioned in various contexts throughout the book of Acts and the epistles. Paul, as a Roman citizen, appealed to Caesar and was brought to Rome to stand trial (Acts 25:11-12; 28:16). He spent at least two years under house arrest in Rome, during which time he wrote several epistles (Acts 28:30-31; Eph. 6:20; Phil. 1:13; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1:1). Paul also expressed his desire to visit the church in Rome (Acts 19:21; Rom. 1:10-15; 15:23-24). The church in Rome, though not founded by Paul, was well-established and included both Jewish and Gentile believers (Acts 28:17-28; Rom. 1:7; 16:3-16). Rome was also the place where Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews, including Aquila and Priscilla, leading them to settle in Corinth (Acts 18:2). Tradition holds that both Paul and Peter were martyred in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. The city of Rome, with its political and cultural significance, served as a strategic center for the spread of the gospel and the growth of the early church.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Salamis was a city on the island of Cyprus where Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel in the Jewish synagogues (Acts 13:5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Salamis was a city located on the eastern coast of the island of Cyprus. It was one of the first places visited by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journey, as recorded in the book of Acts. After being sent out by the church in Antioch, they arrived in Salamis and proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues (Acts 13:4-5). Salamis was a significant port city and a center of commerce, with a sizeable Jewish population. The city was destroyed by an earthquake in the 4th century AD and was later rebuilt as Constantia. Today, the ruins of ancient Salamis can be found near the modern city of Famagusta, in the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Salecah, also known as Salchah or Salcah, was a city located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. It was part of the kingdom of Og, the Amorite king of Bashan, who was defeated by the Israelites under Moses' leadership (Deut. 3:10; Josh. 12:5). After the conquest of Bashan, Salecah was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Josh. 13:11). The city is also mentioned in the description of the territory of Gad, where it is said that the Gadites lived in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah (1 Chr. 5:11). The exact location of Salecah is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the modern-day Hauran region of Syria, east of the Sea of Galilee.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Salim is mentioned in the Gospel of John as a place near Aenon where John the Baptist was baptizing people. The text notes that John chose this location because there was plenty of water available (John 3:23). The exact location of Salim is uncertain, but it was likely situated somewhere in the Jordan Valley, possibly near the Jordan River or one of its tributaries. Some scholars suggest that Salim may be identified with the modern-day village of Ain Salim, located east of Nablus in the West Bank, while others propose alternative locations. The proximity to water was essential for John's baptismal ministry, as it allowed for full immersion of those who came to be baptized.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Salmone was a promontory on the island of Crete that Paul's ship passed on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27:7).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Salmone is mentioned in the book of Acts as a promontory or coastal feature on the island of Crete. During Paul's voyage to Rome as a prisoner, the ship he was on sailed along the southern coast of Crete, opposite Salmone (Acts 27:7). This reference provides a geographical marker for the route taken by the ship before it encountered difficult sailing conditions and eventually shipwrecked on the island of Malta (Acts 27:8-44). Salmone is believed to be the modern-day Cape Sidero, the northeastern extremity of Crete, which extends into the Mediterranean Sea. The mention of Salmone in Acts helps to trace the path of Paul's journey and highlights the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled throughout the Roman Empire.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Salt Sea, also referred to as the Sea of Arabah, is the biblical name for what is now known as the Dead Sea. It is a large, landlocked salt lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley, bordered by Israel and the West Bank to the west and Jordan to the east. The Salt Sea is fed by the Jordan River and is known for its high salt content, which makes it inhospitable to marine life. In the Bible, the Salt Sea is often used as a geographical marker, particularly in relation to the boundaries of the Promised Land (Num. 34:3, 12; Josh. 15:2, 5; 18:19). It is also mentioned in the context of historical events, such as the battle between the kings of the region and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:3) and the extent of Jeroboam II's territorial expansion (2 Ki. 14:25). The Salt Sea's unique characteristics, including its low elevation and high salinity, have made it a significant feature in the biblical landscape.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Salt Valley was a location where David and his commanders defeated the Edomites and Arameans (2 Sa. 8:13; 2 Ki. 14:7; 1 Chr. 18:12; 2 Chr. 25:11; Psa. 60:1).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Salt Valley, also known as the Valley of Salt, is a location mentioned in the Bible where David and his commanders achieved significant military victories. In 2 Samuel 8:13 and 1 Chronicles 18:12, it is recorded that David's commander Abishai defeated 18,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley. Later, in 2 Kings 14:7 and 2 Chronicles 25:11, King Amaziah of Judah is said to have killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. The exact location of the Salt Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the Dead Sea, possibly in the Arabah region south of the Dead Sea. The valley's name suggests an area with high salt content, which is characteristic of the Dead Sea region. Psalm 60, which is attributed to David, also mentions the Salt Valley in the context of military victories (Psa. 60:1). These biblical accounts highlight the Salt Valley as a place of significant military confrontations between Israel and its neighbors, particularly the Edomites.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Samaria was the capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel, and its inhabitants were known as Samaritans (1 Ki. 16:24; 2 Ki. 17:24; Jhn. 4:9; Acts 8:5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Samaria, the capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel, was built by King Omri around 880 BC (1 Ki. 16:24). The city served as the royal residence and the center of political power for the northern kingdom until its fall to the Assyrians in 722 BC (2 Ki. 17:5-6). After the Assyrian conquest, the region of Samaria was repopulated with people from various parts of the Assyrian Empire (2 Ki. 17:24), who intermarried with the remaining Israelites and became known as Samaritans. ¶The Samaritans developed their own religious practices, which combined elements of Israelite tradition with foreign customs (2 Ki. 17:26-28). They worshipped at Mount Gerizim instead of Jerusalem (Jhn. 4:20) and accepted only the first five books of the Bible as authoritative. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus encountered a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well (Jhn. 4:7-26) and used a Samaritan as an example of compassion in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luk. 10:33). The early church spread to Samaria through the ministry of Philip (Acts 8:5-25), and the apostles Peter and John later visited the region (Acts 8:14-17). ¶Throughout the Bible, Samaria and the Samaritans are often portrayed as being in tension with the Jews due to religious and cultural differences (Jhn. 4:9; 8:48). However, Jesus and the early church demonstrated that the gospel was meant for all people, including the Samaritans.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Samos is a Greek island located in the eastern Aegean Sea, near the coast of modern-day Turkey. In the Bible, Samos is mentioned only once, in the context of Paul's third missionary journey. Acts 20:15 records that Paul and his companions, after leaving Miletus, arrived at Samos and stayed there for a night before proceeding to Miletus. Samos was known in ancient times for its strategic location, its fertile land, and its cultural achievements. The island was an important center of trade and learning, and it was the birthplace of several notable philosophers, mathematicians, and artists. Paul's brief stop at Samos demonstrates the extent of his travels and the strategic importance of the island as a transit point in the Aegean Sea.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Samothrace is an island in the Aegean Sea where Paul and his companions landed during his second missionary journey (Acts 16:11).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Samothrace is a Greek island located in the northern Aegean Sea, south of the ancient city of Neapolis (modern-day Kavala) and west of the region of Thrace. In the Bible, Samothrace is mentioned once, in the context of Paul's second missionary journey. Acts 16:11 records that Paul and his companions, after leaving Troas, sailed directly to Samothrace and then on to Neapolis the following day. Samothrace was known in ancient times for its religious significance, particularly the mystery cult of the Cabeiri, which attracted initiates from across the Greek world. The island was also an important stopping point for ships navigating the northern Aegean Sea. Paul's voyage to Samothrace demonstrates the island's role as a transit point in the region and provides insight into the route of his missionary travels.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Seba is mentioned in the Bible as a distant kingdom, often in the context of bringing gifts and offering homage to God or His anointed king. In Psalm 72:10, the kings of Sheba and Seba are described as presenting gifts to the Messianic king. In Isaiah 43:3, God promises to give Egypt, Cush, and Seba as a ransom for Israel, indicating their value and the lengths to which God will go to redeem His people. ¶The exact location of Seba is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Cush (modern-day Sudan) or the Arabian Peninsula. Some scholars suggest that Seba may have been a part of the kingdom of Sheba (modern-day Yemen), known for its wealth and trade in spices, gold, and precious stones. ¶The biblical references to Seba highlight the universal acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the submission of nations to His anointed king. The inclusion of Seba in prophetic and poetic texts also underscores the far-reaching impact of God's redemptive plan and the ultimate gathering of all nations to worship Him.</ext_description>

The exact location of Sebam is unknown, but it was likely in the vicinity of other towns mentioned in the same list, such as Heshbon and Elealeh. No other information about the town is provided in the Bible, and its history and significance remain obscure. The request for these towns by Reuben and Gad suggests that the region was suitable for livestock and agriculture, which were the primary occupations of these tribes.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Second Quarter is mentioned in the Bible as a district or section of Jerusalem. It is first referenced in connection with the prophetess Huldah, who lived in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah (2 Ki. 22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22). When the book of the Law was found in the temple, Josiah sent messengers to consult Huldah, who then prophesied about the impending judgment on Judah and Jerusalem. ¶The Second Quarter is also mentioned in the prophecy of Zephaniah, where it is listed among the places in Jerusalem that would experience distress and destruction (Zeph. 1:10). This suggests that the Second Quarter was a significant residential area within the city. ¶The exact location and boundaries of the Second Quarter are not specified in the Bible. However, its mention in both historical and prophetic texts indicates that it was a recognized district in Jerusalem during the time of the Judean monarchy.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Secu is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of Saul's pursuit of David (1 Sam. 19:22). When David fled from Saul's court, he sought refuge with the prophet Samuel in Ramah. Saul sent messengers to capture David, but when they encountered a group of prophets prophesying, they also began to prophesy. Saul then went to Ramah himself, and the Spirit of God came upon him, causing him to prophesy as well. ¶As Saul continued his journey, he came to a place called Secu, where he inquired about the whereabouts of Samuel and David. The exact location of Secu is unknown, but it was likely in the vicinity of Ramah, a town in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. ¶The mention of Secu in this narrative highlights the extent of Saul's pursuit of David and the unusual circumstances that prevented him from apprehending his perceived rival. It also demonstrates the power of God's Spirit to intervene and protect His chosen servants.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Seir was a mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau (Gen. 32:3; 36:8; Num. 24:18; Deut. 2:4; Josh. 24:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Seir is a mountainous region mentioned frequently in the Bible, located in the southern part of the Transjordan, extending from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. It was inhabited by the Horites before the descendants of Esau, the Edomites, dispossessed them (Gen. 14:6; Deut. 2:12, 22). ¶Seir is closely associated with Esau and his descendants, the Edomites (Gen. 32:3; 33:14, 16; 36:8, 9). It is often used interchangeably with Edom to refer to the nation that emerged from Esau's lineage (Gen. 36:30; Num. 24:18; Deut. 2:4, 8, 29; Josh. 24:4). ¶The region of Seir played a role in several biblical events. It was the location where the kings of the East fought against the Horites (Gen. 14:6). Moses and the Israelites passed through Seir during their wilderness wanderings, but were instructed not to provoke the Edomites to war (Deut. 1:44; 2:4, 8). Later, during the divided monarchy, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela, a stronghold in Seir (2 Chr. 25:11, 14). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel also mention Seir in their oracles, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom (Isa. 21:11; Ezek. 25:8). The region's rugged terrain and strategic location made it a formidable challenge for invading armies and a symbol of Edom's strength and pride.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Seir is a specific mountain or mountainous region within the larger area of Seir, which was inhabited by the Edomites. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of the Israelites' interactions with the Edomites during their wilderness wanderings and later in their history. ¶Mount Seir is first mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy, where it is described as an eleven-day journey from Horeb (Sinai) by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea (Deut. 1:2). The Israelites were instructed to turn away from Mount Seir and pass through the territory of their brothers, the descendants of Esau, without provoking them (Deut. 2:1, 5). ¶During the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came against Judah by way of Mount Seir (2 Chr. 20:10, 22, 23). However, God caused these enemies to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat and the deliverance of Judah. ¶The prophet Ezekiel also delivered oracles against Mount Seir, declaring God's judgment against the Edomites for their hostility towards Israel (Ezek. 35:2, 3, 7, 15). This judgment would result in the desolation of Mount Seir and the recognition of God's sovereignty. ¶The specific location of Mount Seir within the region of Seir is not clearly defined in the Bible. However, its association with the Edomites and its strategic importance in military campaigns suggest that it was a prominent and well-fortified area within the mountainous region of Seir.</ext_description>

This Mount Seir is distinct from the more well-known Mount Seir in Edom, which is associated with Esau and his descendants. The name &quot;Seir&quot; means &quot;shaggy&quot; or &quot;wooded,&quot; suggesting that this mountain was likely a wooded height. Its exact location is uncertain, but it may be part of the range that runs northeast from Saris by Karyat el-'Anab and Biddu to the plateau of el-Jib.

From there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, rallying the Israelites to battle against the Moabites. The exact location of Seirah is unknown, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Gilgal. The name &quot;Seirah&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word &quot;se'ar,&quot; meaning &quot;hairy&quot; or &quot;shaggy,&quot; possibly referring to the wooded nature of the area.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sela, also known as rock or Joktheel, was an Edomite stronghold captured by King Amaziah of Judah (2 Ki. 14:7; 2 Chr. 25:12; Isa. 16:1; 42:11; Judg. 1:36).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sela, meaning &quot;rock&quot; in Hebrew, was an Edomite stronghold located in the mountainous region of Seir. It is also referred to as Joktheel, a name given to it by King Amaziah of Judah after he captured it (2 Ki. 14:7; 2 Chr. 25:12). Sela is mentioned in several biblical passages, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom (Isa. 16:1; 42:11). The city was known for its strategic location and natural defenses, as it was situated in a valley surrounded by steep cliffs. Sela is believed to be the ancient name for the city of Petra, the capital of the Nabataean kingdom, which was carved into the rock faces of the surrounding mountains. The Nabataeans, who inhabited the area after the Edomites, further developed the city and its impressive rock-cut architecture. Today, the ruins of Petra are a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Seleucia was the port city from which Paul and Barnabas sailed to Cyprus on their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Seleucia, also known as Seleucia Pieria, was a port city located near the mouth of the Orontes River on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. It served as the seaport for the city of Antioch, which was located about 16 miles inland. Seleucia was founded by Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander the Great's generals, around 300 BC and became an important center of trade and commerce in the Seleucid Empire. In the New Testament, Seleucia is mentioned in Acts 13:4 as the place from which Paul and Barnabas set sail for Cyprus on their first missionary journey after being sent out by the church in Antioch. The city's strategic location made it an ideal starting point for sea travel to the Mediterranean islands and beyond. Today, the ruins of ancient Seleucia can be found near the modern Turkish city of Samandağ.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Senaah was a town whose people are listed among those who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile (Ezr. 2:35; Neh. 7:38).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Senaah is mentioned in the lists of people who returned to Judah from the Babylonian exile, as recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezr. 2:35; Neh. 7:38). The name &quot;Senaah&quot; is likely a variant of &quot;Hassenaah,&quot; which means &quot;the thorny&quot; or &quot;the pointed&quot; in Hebrew. In both lists, the people of Senaah are counted among those who returned to their homeland under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah. The town of Senaah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. It was probably a small settlement in Judah, possibly near Jerusalem, where the returning exiles resettled after the Babylonian captivity. The inclusion of Senaah in these lists highlights the importance of recording the names and numbers of those who returned from exile, as they played a crucial role in rebuilding the Jewish community and restoring worship in Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Seneh is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of Jonathan's daring attack on the Philistine garrison at Michmash (1 Sam. 14:4). Seneh was one of two rocky crags, the other being Bozez, between which Jonathan and his armor-bearer had to pass to reach the Philistine outpost. The name &quot;Seneh&quot; means &quot;thorny&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot; in Hebrew, suggesting that the crag was sharp and difficult to traverse. The passage describes the challenging terrain, with cliffs on both sides of the pass, emphasizing the bravery and faith of Jonathan and his companion as they ventured into enemy territory. Their successful attack on the Philistines, despite the odds, demonstrated their trust in God and inspired the Israelites to pursue and defeat the Philistine army.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sephar is mentioned in the Bible as part of the description of the territory settled by the descendants of Joktan, the son of Eber (Gen. 10:30). The text states that the territory extended &quot;from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.&quot; The exact location of Sephar is unknown, but it is described as a mountain in the eastern region. Some scholars suggest that Sephar may be associated with the ancient city of Zafar (or Dhofar) in modern-day Yemen, which was an important center of the incense trade in ancient times. However, this identification remains uncertain due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The mention of Sephar in the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) highlights the geographical spread of the descendants of Noah's sons and the development of various nations and people groups in the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sepharad, possibly referring to Sardis, was a destination of exiled Jews (Obad. 1:20) and one of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation (Rev. 1:11; 3:1, 4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sepharad is mentioned in the Bible as a place where exiled Jews were located (Obad. 1:20). The exact location of Sepharad is uncertain, but many scholars believe it refers to Sardis, an ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia and later became an important city in the Persian and Roman empires. ¶In the book of Revelation, Sardis is mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed by Jesus (Rev. 1:11; 3:1, 4). The church in Sardis is rebuked for its spiritual deadness and is called to repent and strengthen what remains (Rev. 3:1-3). However, there were a few faithful believers in Sardis who had not defiled their garments, and they are promised to walk with Jesus in white (Rev. 3:4). ¶If Sepharad and Sardis are indeed the same place, the reference in Obadiah suggests that a Jewish community existed there, possibly as a result of the Babylonian exile. The mention of Sardis in Revelation highlights the city's significance in early Christian history and the challenges faced by the church in that location.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sepharvaim is mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities from which the Assyrians brought people to resettle in Samaria after the deportation of the Israelites (2 Ki. 17:24, 31). The people of Sepharvaim, along with those from other cities, were brought in to replace the exiled Israelites and to populate the cities of Samaria. These foreign settlers brought with them their own gods and religious practices, including the worship of Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim (2 Ki. 17:31). The exact location of Sepharvaim is uncertain, but it is mentioned alongside other cities conquered by the Assyrians, such as Hamath and Arpad (2 Ki. 18:34; 19:13; Isa. 36:19; 37:13). Some scholars propose that Sepharvaim may be identified with the Babylonian city of Sippar, located on the east bank of the Euphrates River, while others suggest it could be a city in Syria or Cilicia. The resettlement of people from Sepharvaim and other cities in Samaria contributed to the mixed religious and cultural background of the Samaritans, who were later regarded with animosity by the Jews.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shaalbim, also known as Shaalabbin, was a town allotted to the tribe of Dan in the territorial distribution of Canaan (Josh. 19:42). However, the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Shaalbim and its neighboring towns, Beth-shemesh and Aijalon, forcing the Danites into the hill country (Judg. 1:35). The town was later included in the administrative district overseen by Ben-Deker during Solomon's reign (1 Ki. 4:9). Shaalbim is also notable as the hometown of Eliahba the Shaalbonite, one of David's mighty men (2 Sam. 23:32; 1 Chr. 11:33). The term &quot;Shaalbonite&quot; indicates a person from Shaalbim, highlighting the town's significance in providing valiant warriors for David's army. The exact location of Shaalbim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the lowlands between the central hill country and the coastal plain of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shaalim is mentioned briefly in the Bible as a region through which Saul and his servant passed while searching for Saul's father's lost donkeys (1 Sam. 9:4). The passage states that they went through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find the donkeys. They then passed through the land of Shaalim and the land of Benjamin, still without success. The exact location of Shaalim is unknown, but it was likely situated in the central hill country of Israel, north of Jerusalem. The mention of Shaalim in this narrative serves to highlight the extent of Saul's search for the donkeys and the various regions he traversed before encountering the prophet Samuel, who would anoint him as the first king of Israel. The fact that Shaalim is mentioned only once in the Bible, and without any further details, suggests that it was a relatively obscure or minor region in the landscape of ancient Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shaaraim, meaning &quot;two gates,&quot; was a town located in the Shephelah (lowland hills) of Judah, mentioned in close association with Socoh and Azekah (Josh. 15:36). The town is also referenced in the account of David's victory over Goliath and the Philistines (1 Sam. 17). After the Philistines were defeated at Socoh, they retreated down the valley of Elah (modern Wadi es-Sant) toward Gath and Ekron, passing by Shaaraim (1 Sam. 17:52). Some scholars suggest that the &quot;two gates&quot; mentioned in this passage may refer to the Philistine strongholds of Gath and Ekron themselves, rather than a specific town. The exact location of Shaaraim is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Tell Zakariya or Khirbet Sa'ireh, both located in the Shephelah region. However, these identifications remain speculative due to limited archaeological evidence.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shallecheth was a gate in Jerusalem assigned to the Levites Shuppim and Hosah for guard duty (1 Chr. 26:16).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shallecheth, meaning &quot;casting down,&quot; was one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned in the assignment of guard duties to the Levites during the reign of King David (1 Chr. 26:16). The gate was assigned to Shuppim and Hosah, along with the storehouse. The exact location of the Shallecheth Gate is uncertain, but it was likely situated on the western side of the city, possibly near the Temple Mount. Some scholars suggest that the name &quot;Shallecheth&quot; may refer to a refuse gate where ashes and other debris from the temple were discarded. Others propose that it could have been a gate used for the disposal of sacrificial remains. However, these interpretations remain speculative due to the limited information provided in the biblical text. The assignment of Levites to guard the Shallecheth Gate highlights the importance of maintaining the security and sanctity of the temple area and the city of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shamir was a man from the hill country of Ephraim who judged Israel for 23 years (Judg. 10:1-2). He was the son of Puah and a member of the tribe of Issachar. After the death of Abimelech, Shamir arose to save Israel, indicating a time of crisis or oppression from which he delivered the people. He died and was buried in Shamir, his hometown in the hill country of Ephraim. Some scholars propose identifying Shamir with the town of Sanur on the road from Nablus to Jenin, but this remains uncertain as Sanur was likely outside the territory of Issachar. The Septuagint's Codex Alexandrinus reads &quot;Samareia&quot; instead of &quot;Shamir,&quot; adding further complexity to the identification of the location.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shamir was a town in the hill country of Judah (Josh. 15:48).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shamir is mentioned in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah in the hill country (Josh. 15:48). The town is listed along with other settlements in the region, such as Jattir, Socoh, and Debir. The exact location of Shamir is unknown, but it was situated in the central hill country of Judah, south of Jerusalem. The name &quot;Shamir&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;thorn&quot; or &quot;flint,&quot; possibly indicating the presence of thorny vegetation or rocky terrain in the area. No other information about the town is provided in the biblical text, and its history and significance remain obscure. The mention of Shamir in the territorial allotment of Judah demonstrates the extent of the tribe's inheritance and provides insight into the geographical distribution of settlements in the hill country during the period of the conquest and settlement of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shaphir is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the prophet Micah's oracle against the towns of Judah (Mic. 1:11). In his prophecy, Micah addresses Shaphir, urging the inhabitants to pass on in nakedness and shame, a sign of humiliation and judgment. The exact location of Shaphir is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah. The name &quot;Shaphir&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;pleasant,&quot; possibly indicating the town's attractive appearance or setting. However, the prophecy suggests that Shaphir's beauty would be stripped away as a result of God's judgment on the nation. The mention of Shaphir alongside other towns in Micah's oracle highlights the widespread nature of the divine judgment and the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sharon is a coastal plain mentioned several times in the Bible, known for its beauty, fertility, and lush pastureland. It stretches along the Mediterranean coast from Joppa to Mount Carmel. The region was famous for its flowers, particularly the Rose of Sharon (Song 2:1), and its productive fields and forests (Isa. 35:2). During the reign of King David, Sharon was known for its herds of cattle, overseen by Shitrai the Sharonite (1 Chr. 27:29). The prophet Isaiah used Sharon as a symbol of fruitfulness and blessing, contrasting it with the desolation brought by God's judgment (Isa. 33:9; 65:10). In the New Testament, the plain of Sharon is mentioned in connection with the ministry of the apostle Peter, who healed Aeneas in Lydda and proclaimed the gospel throughout the region (Acts 9:35). The fertile soil and moderate climate of Sharon made it a prosperous agricultural area, supporting a variety of crops and livestock. Its location along the coastal trade routes also contributed to its economic significance in ancient Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sharon is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 5:16 as a region east of the Jordan River where the descendants of Gad pastured their flocks. This reference occurs in the context of the genealogy and territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad. The Gadites, known for their skill in warfare and their large numbers of livestock, settled in the region of Gilead and Bashan, which included the area of Sharon. This Sharon is distinct from the well-known coastal plain of Sharon west of the Jordan. The exact location and extent of this eastern Sharon are not specified in the biblical text. It likely refers to a fertile grazing area within the territory of Gad, suitable for the tribe's extensive herds and flocks. The mention of Sharon in this context highlights the importance of livestock and pastureland in the economy and lifestyle of the Gadites.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sharuhen, also known as Shaaraim or Shilhim, was a town allotted to the tribe of Simeon within the territory of Judah (Josh. 19:6; 1 Chr. 4:31; Josh. 15:32). The different names may refer to the same place or to closely related settlements in the same area. Sharuhen is listed among the towns in the southern part of Judah's territory, in the Negev region. It was one of the towns given to Simeon when the tribe received an inheritance within Judah's allotment (Josh. 19:1-9). The exact location of Sharuhen is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the semi-arid region south of Hebron. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Far'ah, a site about 12 miles south of Gaza, where excavations have revealed remains from the Middle Bronze Age and later periods. However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The mention of Sharuhen in the lists of towns allotted to Simeon and Judah highlights the close relationship between the two tribes and the integration of Simeon's territory within Judah's borders.</ext_description>

The name &quot;Shaveh Kiriathaim&quot; means &quot;the plain of Kiriathaim,&quot; indicating its proximity to the city of Kiriathaim. In the course of their conquests, Chedorlaomer and his confederates defeated the Emites, a group of giants, in Shaveh Kiriathaim. This event took place before the battle against the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Valley of Siddim. The exact location of Shaveh Kiriathaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region east of the Dead Sea, in what would later become the territory of Moab. The mention of Shaveh Kiriathaim in the context of these ancient battles highlights the geopolitical landscape of the region during the time of Abraham and the power struggles among the various kingdoms and peoples of the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sheba, also known as the South, was an ancient kingdom located in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in modern-day Yemen. It was renowned for its wealth, derived from its control of the spice and incense trade routes. The Bible mentions Sheba in connection with its trade in gold, spices, precious stones, and incense (1 Ki. 10:2, 10; 2 Chr. 9:1, 9; Ps. 72:15; Isa. 60:6; Jer. 6:20; Ezek. 27:22). ¶The most famous biblical account involving Sheba is the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon (1 Ki. 10:1-13; 2 Chr. 9:1-12). Intrigued by reports of Solomon's wisdom and prosperity, the queen journeyed to Jerusalem with a great caravan, bearing gifts of gold, spices, and precious stones. She tested Solomon with hard questions and was impressed by his wisdom and the splendor of his court. The queen praised Solomon and his God, acknowledging the divine source of his wisdom and success. ¶Sheba is also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts, often as a symbol of distant and exotic lands (Ps. 72:10; Isa. 60:6; Ezek. 38:13). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Queen of the South (Sheba) as one who will rise up in judgment against those who reject His message, emphasizing her recognition of wisdom and truth (Luke 11:31). ¶The kingdom of Sheba played a significant role in the trade networks of the ancient Near East, and its mention in the Bible attests to its fame and influence during the biblical period.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shebarim was a place near Ai where the Israelites fled after being defeated due to Achan's sin (Josh. 7:5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shebarim is mentioned briefly in the account of Israel's defeat at Ai (Josh. 7:5). After the conquest of Jericho, the Israelites attacked the city of Ai but were defeated because of Achan's sin of taking devoted things from Jericho. As a result, the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six Israelites and pursued them from the city gate as far as Shebarim. ¶The exact location of Shebarim is unknown, but it was likely a place near Ai where the terrain allowed the defenders to overtake the fleeing Israelites. The name &quot;Shebarim&quot; means &quot;the breaks&quot; or &quot;the quarries,&quot; possibly indicating a rocky or broken landscape that made escape difficult. ¶The mention of Shebarim in this narrative highlights the consequences of disobedience and sin within the Israelite camp. Achan's violation of God's command led to defeat and humiliation at the hands of a smaller enemy force. The pursuit of the Israelites to Shebarim underscores the extent of their defeat and the vulnerability caused by their failure to uphold God's standards of holiness.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shechem was a prominent city in Canaan, later allotted to the tribe of Ephraim, and the site of important events in Israel's history (Gen. 12:6; 33:18-20; Josh. 20:7; 24:1, 25-26; Judg. 9; 1 Ki. 12:1, 25; Ps. 60:6; 108:7; Acts 7:16).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shechem was an important city in central Canaan, located in the hill country between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Bible, often in connection with significant events in Israel's history. ¶Shechem first appears in the account of Abraham's journey to Canaan, where he built an altar to the Lord (Gen. 12:6-7). Later, Jacob settled near Shechem and purchased a piece of land, setting up an altar there (Gen. 33:18-20). However, the city also became the site of violence when Jacob's daughter Dinah was violated by Shechem, the son of Hamor, leading to the massacre of the city's male inhabitants by Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi (Gen. 34). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Shechem was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim and designated as a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7; 21:21). Joshua gathered the tribes at Shechem to renew the covenant and set up a stone of remembrance (Josh. 24:1, 25-26). The city later became the site of Abimelech's short-lived kingdom (Judg. 9) and was rebuilt by Jeroboam as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel (1 Ki. 12:25). ¶Shechem held religious significance, as evidenced by the blessings and curses pronounced from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33). The city is also mentioned in the Psalms as a symbol of God's dominion over Israel (Ps. 60:6; 108:7). ¶In the New Testament, Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrin mentions Shechem as the burial place of Jacob and his sons (Acts 7:16), although this differs from the Old Testament account of their burial at Hebron (Gen. 49:29-33; 50:13). ¶Shechem's location at the crossroads of major trade routes contributed to its strategic and economic importance. The city's history, marked by both sacred events and periods of violence, reflects the complex dynamics of Israelite settlement and inter-tribal relations in Canaan.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shelah, also called Shiloah, the King's Pool, or Siloam, was a pool in Jerusalem fed by the Gihon Spring via Hezekiah's Tunnel (Neh. 3:15; Isa. 8:6; Neh. 2:14; Luke 13:4; John 9:7, 11).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shelah, also known as Shiloah, the King's Pool, or Siloam, was a pool located in the southeastern part of Jerusalem, near the City of David. It was fed by the waters of the Gihon Spring, which were diverted through Hezekiah's Tunnel, a remarkable engineering feat of the 8th century BC (2 Chr. 32:30; Isa. 22:11). ¶The pool is mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible. In the time of Nehemiah, the wall of Jerusalem was repaired near the Pool of Shelah (Neh. 3:15), and Nehemiah himself inspected the walls by the King's Pool (Neh. 2:14). The prophet Isaiah used the gently flowing waters of Shiloah as a metaphor for the calm and trust in God, in contrast to the mighty waters of the Euphrates, symbolizing the Assyrian threat (Isa. 8:6). ¶In the New Testament, Jesus healed a man born blind by sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam (John 9:7, 11). This miracle not only demonstrated Jesus' power but also served as a spiritual lesson about faith and the true identity of the Messiah. The Gospel of Luke also records an incident where eighteen people were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them (Luke 13:4), using this event to teach about the need for repentance. ¶The Pool of Siloam has been identified with the archaeological site known as the Siloam Pool, which was discovered in 2004. Excavations have revealed a large pool from the Second Temple period, consistent with the biblical descriptions and historical accounts of the site.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shen is mentioned briefly in the account of Samuel's leadership over Israel (1 Sam. 7:12). After the Israelites repented of their idolatry and turned back to the Lord, Samuel led them in a decisive victory over the Philistines. To commemorate this victory and God's help, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, naming it Ebenezer, which means &quot;stone of help.&quot; The exact location of Shen is not specified in the biblical text, but it was likely a place near Mizpah, in the territory of Benjamin. The setting up of the Ebenezer stone at Shen served as a reminder of God's deliverance and the importance of relying on His strength in the face of enemy threats. This event marked a significant moment in Israel's history, as it demonstrated the nation's renewed commitment to the Lord and His faithfulness in granting them victory over their oppressors.</ext_description>

It is listed as one of the landmarks on the northeastern border, situated between Hazar-enan and Riblah.

The inclusion of Shepham in the boundary description highlights the extent of the territory God intended for the Israelites to possess and the importance of defining the limits of the Promised Land. These boundaries served as a guide for the allotment of the land among the tribes and a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to His people.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Shephelah, meaning &quot;lowland&quot; in Hebrew, refers to the fertile foothills and valleys located between the Judean hills and the coastal plain of Israel. This region is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of military campaigns, agricultural abundance, and territorial allotment. ¶The Shephelah was known for its strategic importance, as it served as a natural buffer between the hill country of Judah and the Philistine cities along the coast. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and the Israelites fought against the kings of the Shephelah (Josh. 9:1; 10:40; 11:2, 16; 12:8). The region was allotted to the tribes of Judah and Dan (Josh. 15:33; Judg. 1:9). ¶The Shephelah was renowned for its fertility and agricultural productivity. It was a region where wheat, barley, grapes, and olives were cultivated (1 Chr. 27:28; 2 Chr. 26:10). The abundance of sycamore and cedar trees in the Shephelah was compared to the abundance of stones during Solomon's reign (1 Ki. 10:27; 2 Chr. 1:15; 9:27). ¶The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah mention the Shephelah in their prophecies, highlighting its importance and the restoration of its cities and villages (Jer. 17:26; 32:44; 33:13; Zech. 7:7). The prophet Obadiah also foretells that the people of the Shephelah will possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria (Obad. 1:19). ¶The Shephelah played a significant role in the history of ancient Israel, serving as a region of strategic, agricultural, and prophetic importance. Its fertile valleys and proximity to major trade routes made it a valuable and contested area throughout the biblical period.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shihor-libnath is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the description of the territory allotted to the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:26). It is listed as one of the boundary points, along with other towns and landmarks such as Helkath, Mount Carmel, and Dor. The exact location of Shihor-libnath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the coastal region of northern Israel, near the Mediterranean Sea. The name &quot;Shihor-libnath&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew words &quot;shihor&quot; (black) and &quot;libnath&quot; (white), possibly referring to the contrast between the dark river and the white limestone cliffs in the area. Some scholars suggest that Shihor-libnath may be associated with the Crocodile River (modern-day Nahal Taninim) or the nearby town of Achzib.

		<short_description>Shikkeron was a town on the northern border of Judah's territory, near Mount Baalah (Josh. 15:11).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shikkeron is mentioned briefly in the description of the northern border of Judah's territory (Josh. 15:11). It is listed along with Mount Baalah and Jabneel as landmarks defining the boundary. The exact location of Shikkeron is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah region, the lowlands between the central hill country and the coastal plain of Israel. No other information about Shikkeron is provided in the biblical text, and its history and significance remain obscure. The mention of Shikkeron in the boundary description highlights the extent of Judah's territory and the various towns and landmarks that marked its borders. The inclusion of such details in the book of Joshua emphasizes the importance of the allotment of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land as an inheritance.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shiloh was an important Israelite sanctuary and assembly point during the period of the judges, where the tabernacle was set up and the land was allotted to the tribes (Josh. 18:1, 8-10; 19:51; 21:2; 22:9, 12; Judg. 18:31; 21:12, 19, 21; 1 Sam. 1:3, 9, 24; 2:14; 3:21; 4:3, 4, 12; 14:3; 1 Ki. 2:27; 14:2, 4; Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9; 41:5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shiloh was an important religious center and assembly point for the Israelites during the period of the judges. After the conquest of Canaan, the tabernacle was set up at Shiloh, and it served as the central place of worship for the nation (Josh. 18:1; 19:51). It was at Shiloh that the land was allotted to the tribes of Israel (Josh. 18:8-10; 21:2) and where the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh were dismissed to their territories east of the Jordan (Josh. 22:9, 12). ¶During the time of the judges, Shiloh continued to be a significant religious site. The tabernacle remained at Shiloh throughout this period (Judg. 18:31), and annual festivals were held there (Judg. 21:19, 21). It was at Shiloh that Hannah prayed for a son and dedicated Samuel to the Lord's service (1 Sam. 1:3, 9, 24). The priest Eli and his sons ministered at the tabernacle in Shiloh (1 Sam. 2:14; 3:21; 4:3, 4, 12), and the Ark of the Covenant was kept there until it was captured by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3, 4). ¶Shiloh's importance declined after the Ark was taken and the tabernacle was destroyed (Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). The prophet Ahijah, who prophesied the division of the kingdom, was from Shiloh (1 Ki. 11:29; 14:2, 4). The town was eventually destroyed, and its ruins served as a warning against disobedience to God (Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). ¶Shiloh's significance in the biblical narrative lies in its role as a religious and political center during the formative years of Israel's history. Its central location in the hill country of Ephraim made it a convenient meeting place for the tribes and a symbol of their unity under the worship of the Lord.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shimron, also called Shimron-meron, was a Canaanite city conquered by Joshua (Josh. 11:1; 12:20) and later allotted to the tribe of Zebulun (Josh. 19:15).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shimron, also known as Shimron-meron, was a Canaanite city mentioned in the conquest narratives of the book of Joshua. It first appears in the account of the northern coalition of Canaanite kings who gathered to fight against Israel (Josh. 11:1). The king of Shimron-meron is listed among those who joined forces with Jabin, king of Hazor, to oppose Joshua and the Israelites. ¶In the subsequent battle, Joshua and the Israelites defeated the Canaanite coalition, including the king of Shimron-meron (Josh. 12:20). The city of Shimron was later allotted to the tribe of Zebulun as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Josh. 19:15). ¶The exact location of Shimron is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, in the region later known as Galilee. Some scholars propose identifying Shimron with the archaeological site of Tel Shimron, located in the Jezreel Valley, near the modern-day town of Timrat. However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. ¶The mention of Shimron in the conquest narratives highlights the extent of the Canaanite opposition to Israel's entrance into the Promised Land and the subsequent victory of Joshua and the Israelites under God's guidance. The allotment of Shimron to the tribe of Zebulun underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to His people as an inheritance.</ext_description>

It is first mentioned in the Table of Nations as one of the lands associated with Nimrod, along with Babel, Erech, and Accad (Gen. 10:10). Shinar is also identified as the location where the Tower of Babel was built (Gen. 11:2). ¶In the account of the battle between the kings of the east and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, Amraphel, king of Shinar, is listed among the eastern kings (Gen. 14:1, 9). This suggests that Shinar was a significant political entity in the region during the patriarc</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shion is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Issachar during the division of the Promised Land (Josh. 19:19). It is listed along with other towns in the region, such as Shunem, Hapharaim, and Anaharath. The exact location of Shion is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Jezreel Valley, within the territory of Issachar. Some scholars propose identifying Shion with Khirbet Sha'in, an archaeological site located approximately 4 miles northwest of Mount Tabor . However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The name &quot;Shion&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew verb &quot;shw',&quot; meaning &quot;to be emptied or ravaged&quot; , possibly indicating the town's history or condition. The mention of Shion in the allotment of Issachar's territory highlights the importance of the tribal inheritance and the distribution of towns and lands among the people of Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shittim, also called Abel-shittim, the final Israelite encampment before entering Canaan.</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shittim, also known as Abel-shittim, was the last campsite of the Israelites before they crossed the Jordan River to enter Canaan. It was located in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan and opposite Jericho (Numbers 33:49). At Shittim, the Israelites fell into sin with the Moabite women and worshipped the Moabite god Baal of Peor, resulting in a plague that killed 24,000 people (Numbers 25:1-9). It was also from Shittim that Joshua sent two spies to investigate Jericho (Joshua 2:1) and where the Israelites camped before crossing the Jordan (Joshua 3:1). The prophet Micah later recalled the events at Shittim, from Balaam to the crossing of the Jordan, as evidence of God's righteous acts toward Israel (Micah 6:5).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Shittim Valley is mentioned in the context of the prophet Joel's vision of the restoration of Judah and Jerusalem (Joel 3:18). In this prophecy, Joel describes a future time when the mountains will drip with sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, and all the ravines of Judah will run with water. Specifically, he mentions that a fountain will flow from the house of the Lord and water the Shittim Valley. The exact location of the Shittim Valley is uncertain, but it is likely a reference to the area near the ancient city of Shittim, also known as Abel-shittim, located east of the Jordan River in the plains of Moab (Num. 33:49). This region was the last encampment of the Israelites before they crossed the Jordan to enter the Promised Land (Josh. 3:1). The mention of the Shittim Valley in Joel's prophecy symbolizes the abundant blessings and restoration that God will bring to His people, even to the dry and desolate areas. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in leading the Israelites through the wilderness and into the Promised Land.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Shoa is mentioned briefly in the book of Ezekiel, in the context of a prophecy against Jerusalem and its unfaithfulness to God (Ezek. 23:23). In this prophecy, Ezekiel uses the metaphor of two sisters, Oholah (representing Samaria) and Oholibah (representing Jerusalem), who engaged in prostitution with various nations. Among the nations mentioned are the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and the people of Shoa. The exact identity and location of Shoa are uncertain, but it is likely that they were a people group from the region of Mesopotamia or the Arabian Peninsula. Some scholars propose that Shoa may be a reference to the Sutu, a nomadic people mentioned in Assyrian and Babylonian texts. The inclusion of Shoa in this list of nations highlights the extent of Jerusalem's spiritual unfaithfulness and its alliances with foreign powers. The prophecy warns of the judgment that will come upon Jerusalem for its sins, as God will bring these nations against the city to execute His punishment.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shual was a region raided by Philistine raiders during Saul's reign, along with Ophrah and the land of Shaalim (1 Sam. 13:17).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shual is mentioned in the context of the Philistine threat to Israel during the reign of King Saul (1 Sam. 13:17). After the Philistines assembled a large army at Michmash, they sent out raiding parties in three directions. One company turned toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, while the others went toward Beth-horon and the Valley of Zeboim. The exact location of Shual is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. The name &quot;Shual&quot; means &quot;fox&quot; or &quot;jackal&quot; in Hebrew, possibly indicating the presence of these animals in the region or reflecting the cunning nature of the Philistine raiders. The mention of Shual in this narrative highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during Saul's reign and the challenges faced by the newly established monarchy. It also demonstrates the strategic importance of the region and the need for effective defense against enemy incursions.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shunem was a town allotted to the tribe of Issachar (Josh. 19:18), known for being the home of the Shunammite woman who hosted Elisha (2 Ki. 4:8) and where the Philistines camped before battling Saul (1 Sam. 28:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shunem was a town located in the territory of Issachar, in the Jezreel Valley (Josh. 19:18). It is most well-known as the home of the Shunammite woman, who showed hospitality to the prophet Elisha (2 Ki. 4:8). This woman, recognizing Elisha as a holy man of God, prepared a room for him to stay whenever he passed through the town. In return for her kindness, Elisha prophesied that she would have a son, despite her husband's old age. Later, when the child died, Elisha raised him back to life, demonstrating God's power and the prophet's authority (2 Ki. 4:18-37). ¶Shunem is also mentioned in the context of the conflict between Israel and the Philistines during the reign of King Saul. The Philistines gathered their forces at Shunem, while Saul and the Israelites camped at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. 28:4). It was during this time that Saul, in desperation, sought out a medium to consult the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel (1 Sam. 28:7-25). ¶The town of Shunem was strategically located along the main trade route connecting the Jezreel Valley with the coastal plain. Its mention in various biblical narratives highlights its importance as a regional center and a place of significant events in Israel's history. The account of the Shunammite woman and Elisha also serves as an example of faith, hospitality, and God's power to bring life and restoration.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Shur was a wilderness area between Canaan and Egypt, mentioned in connection with Hagar (Gen. 16:7), Abraham (Gen. 20:1; 25:18), the Israelites' wanderings (Exod. 15:22), and Saul's battles (1 Sam. 15:7; 27:8).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Shur is a wilderness region located between Canaan and Egypt, often mentioned in the context of travels and events in the patriarchal narratives and the early history of Israel. It first appears in the story of Hagar, who fled from Sarah and encountered the angel of the Lord near a spring on the way to Shur (Gen. 16:7). Later, Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur, sojourning in Gerar (Gen. 20:1). The descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, are described as dwelling from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt (Gen. 25:18). ¶During the Exodus, after crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites went three days into the wilderness of Shur before reaching Marah, where God miraculously provided drinkable water (Exod. 15:22). In the time of King Saul, he defeated the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt (1 Sam. 15:7). Later, when David was fleeing from Saul, he and his men raided the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites, who inhabited the land from Telam as far as Shur and Egypt (1 Sam. 27:8). ¶The exact boundaries of the wilderness of Shur are not specified in the Bible, but it appears to have been a desert region stretching from the eastern border of Egypt toward Canaan. Its location along the route between these two regions made it a significant area for travel, trade, and military campaigns in biblical times.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sibmah was a Moabite town known for its vineyards, allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Num. 32:38; Josh. 13:19) and later mentioned in prophecies concerning Moab (Isa. 16:8-9; Jer. 48:32).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sibmah, also known as Sebam (Num. 32:3), was a town located in the territory of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It was initially conquered by the Israelites during their journey to Canaan and allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Num. 32:38; Josh. 13:19). The town was known for its lush vineyards, which were celebrated for their productivity and the quality of their grapes. ¶The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah both mention Sibmah in their prophecies concerning the judgment of Moab. Isaiah laments over the destruction of the vineyards of Sibmah, describing how the rulers of the nations have trampled down its vines that once reached as far as Jazer and the wilderness (Isa. 16:8-9). Similarly, Jeremiah prophesies that the shouting over the summer fruits and the harvest will cease in the fields of Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah (Jer. 48:32). ¶These prophecies indicate that Sibmah, along with other Moabite towns, would face divine judgment for its pride and idolatry. The destruction of its renowned vineyards symbolizes the extent of the coming devastation and the loss of Moab's prosperity and joy. ¶Although the exact location of Sibmah is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated near Heshbon, a prominent Moabite city. The ruins of Qurn el-Kibsh, about 3 miles southwest of Heshbon, have been proposed as a possible site for ancient Sibmah.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sibraim was a place mentioned by Ezekiel as a landmark on the northeastern border of the Promised Land, between the territory of Damascus and that of Hamath (Ezek. 47:16).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sibraim is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the boundaries of the restored Promised Land (Ezek. 47:16). In this vision, Ezekiel describes the northern border of the land, extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Sibraim is listed as one of the landmarks along this border, situated between the territory of Damascus and that of Hamath. ¶The exact location of Sibraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Some scholars propose that it may be identified with the modern-day village of Khirbet Sariman, located about 40 miles northeast of Damascus. However, this identification remains tentative due to the lack of conclusive evidence. ¶Ezekiel's vision of the restored Promised Land and its boundaries, including the mention of Sibraim, emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His plan to restore Israel to its rightful inheritance. The delineation of the land's borders also highlights the importance of God's sovereign allotment and the need for His people to trust in His provision and guidance.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Valley of Siddim, located near the Dead Sea, was the site of a battle between the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and the kings of Elam and their allies (Gen. 14:3, 8, 10).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Valley of Siddim, also known as the Valley of the Dead Sea (Gen. 14:3), was a low-lying area situated near the southern end of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned in the context of the battle between the four kings of the east, led by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and the five kings of the cities of the plain, including the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:8-10). ¶The Valley of Siddim is described as being full of tar pits (Gen. 14:10), which played a significant role in the battle's outcome. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their men fell into these tar pits, while the rest escaped to the hills. This allowed the eastern kings to seize the goods and provisions of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as capture Lot, Abraham's nephew, who was living in Sodom (Gen. 14:11-12). ¶The exact location of the Valley of Siddim is uncertain, as the geography of the region has undergone significant changes since biblical times. Some scholars believe that it may have been located in the area now covered by the southern basin of the Dead Sea, which is much shallower than the northern basin. Others propose that it could have been situated in the nearby plain, south of the Dead Sea. ¶The mention of the Valley of Siddim in the Bible is significant, as it sets the stage for Abraham's rescue of Lot and his subsequent encounter with Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High (Gen. 14:13-20). This event demonstrates Abraham's faith, courage, and loyalty to his family, as well as his reverence for Melchizedek, a figure who foreshadows the priesthood of Christ (Heb. 7:1-10).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Silla is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of the assassination of King Joash of Judah (2 Ki. 12:20). Joash, who had been hiding in the Temple of the Lord, was killed by his servants at the house of Millo, on the way down to Silla. The exact location of Silla is unknown, but it was likely a place in or near Jerusalem, possibly a road or a district in the city. Some scholars propose that Silla may be related to the Hebrew word &quot;mesillah,&quot; meaning &quot;highway&quot; or &quot;causeway,&quot; suggesting that it could have been a major thoroughfare. The assassination of Joash at Silla marked the end of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his son Amaziah (2 Ki. 12:21). This event highlights the political instability and violence that often characterized the monarchy in Judah and Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sin was a wilderness area between Elim and Sinai where the Israelites camped during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land (Exod. 16:1; 17:1; Num. 33:11-12).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sin, also known as the Wilderness of Sin, was a desert region located between Elim and Mount Sinai, through which the Israelites passed during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. The Israelites arrived at the Wilderness of Sin on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from Egypt (Exod. 16:1). ¶It was in the Wilderness of Sin that God first provided manna and quail for the Israelites to eat (Exod. 16:4-36). The people had been grumbling against Moses and Aaron due to the lack of food, and God responded by miraculously supplying them with sustenance. The manna, described as a fine, flake-like substance, appeared every morning except on the Sabbath, and the Israelites were instructed to gather only as much as they needed for each day. ¶The Israelites left the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink (Exod. 17:1). Once again, the people complained against Moses, and God instructed him to strike the rock at Horeb, which miraculously provided water for the entire congregation (Exod. 17:5-7). ¶In the list of the Israelites' campsites recorded in the Book of Numbers, the Wilderness of Sin is mentioned between the campsites of Dophkah and Alush (Num. 33:11-12). ¶The experiences of the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sin, including the provision of manna and water, served as important lessons about God's faithfulness, providence, and the importance of trusting in Him. These events also foreshadowed the spiritual sustenance that God would provide through Jesus Christ, the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-35).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sinai, also called Mount Sinai, Horeb, or Mount Horeb, was the mountain where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and other laws (Exod. 19-40; Lev. 7:38; 25:1; 26:46; 27:34; Num. 3:1; 28:6; Deut. 33:2; Judg. 5:5; Ps. 68:8, 17; Neh. 9:13; Mal. 4:4; Acts 7:30, 38; Gal. 4:24-25).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sinai, also known as Mount Sinai, Horeb, or Mount Horeb, is one of the most significant locations in the Bible. It is the mountain where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments, as well as other laws and instructions for the Israelites. ¶After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites camped at the base of Mount Sinai for about a year (Exod. 19:1-2). During this time, God called Moses to the top of the mountain and spoke to him, giving him the Ten Commandments and other laws (Exod. 19-31). The mountain was filled with smoke, fire, and thunder, symbolizing the awesome presence of God (Exod. 19:16-19). ¶Moses spent forty days and forty nights on the mountain, receiving instructions from God and writing down the laws (Exod. 24:18; 34:28). He also received the two stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments (Exod. 31:18; 34:1, 4, 28-29). ¶The location of Mount Sinai is not specified in the Bible, but tradition has identified it with Jebel Musa (Mountain of Moses) in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula. However, some scholars have proposed alternative locations, such as Jebel al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia, based on various geographical and archaeological considerations. ¶Throughout the Bible, Sinai is mentioned as a symbol of God's revelation, covenant, and law (Deut. 33:2; Judg. 5:5; Ps. 68:8, 17; Neh. 9:13; Mal. 4:4). In the New Testament, Paul uses Sinai as an allegory for the old covenant, in contrast to the new covenant represented by the heavenly Jerusalem (Gal. 4:24-25). ¶The events at Sinai, including the giving of the Ten Commandments and the establishment of the Mosaic covenant, were pivotal moments in the history of Israel and laid the foundation for their identity as God's chosen people.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Sinai Wilderness was the region where the Israelites camped after the Exodus and received the Law.</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Sinai Wilderness, also known as the Wilderness of Sinai, was the desert region in the Sinai Peninsula where the Israelites camped after leaving Egypt (Exodus 19:1-2). It was in this wilderness, at Mount Sinai, that God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and established His covenant with Israel (Leviticus 7:38, Numbers 3:4). The Israelites set up the Tabernacle in the Sinai Wilderness (Numbers 1:1,19; 9:1,5). They took a census of the people there (Numbers 1:19, 26:64). The Sinai Wilderness was one of the early stops on Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land (Numbers 10:12, 33:15-16). The wilderness provided a place of testing and preparation for the nation before they entered Canaan. The Sinai Wilderness is synonymous with the region surrounding Mount Sinai, the place of God's revelation to Moses and Israel.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Siphmoth was one of the towns in southern Judah that received a share of the spoils from David after he defeated the Amalekites (1 Sam. 30:28).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Siphmoth is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of David's distribution of the spoils after his victory over the Amalekites (1 Sam. 30:28). After rescuing his wives and the families of his men from the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag, David sent gifts from the plunder to the elders of various towns in Judah, including Siphmoth. This gesture was likely intended to strengthen David's relationships with these towns and gain their support as he sought to establish his kingdom. The exact location of Siphmoth is unknown, but it was probably situated in the southern part of Judah, near other towns mentioned in the same passage, such as Aroer, Eshtemoa, and Hormah. The name &quot;Siphmoth&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word &quot;sapham,&quot; meaning &quot;to cover&quot; or &quot;to hide,&quot; possibly indicating a concealed or protected location. However, the significance of the name remains uncertain due to the limited information provided in the biblical text.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sirah, also called the Cistern of Sirah, was a place near Hebron where Joab killed Abner in revenge for the death of his brother Asahel (2 Sam. 3:26).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Sirah, also known as the Cistern of Sirah, is mentioned in the account of the murder of Abner by Joab (2 Sam. 3:26). Abner, who had been the commander of Saul's army, had recently defected to David's side after a dispute with Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. Joab, David's military commander, held a grudge against Abner for killing his brother Asahel in battle (2 Sam. 2:18-23). ¶When Abner left David's presence at Hebron, Joab sent messengers after him and brought him back from the Cistern of Sirah. Upon Abner's return, Joab took him aside and stabbed him to death in revenge for his brother's killing (2 Sam. 3:27). ¶The exact location of Sirah is not specified in the biblical text, but it was apparently a well-known landmark near Hebron. The name &quot;Sirah&quot; may be derived from the Hebrew word &quot;sur,&quot; meaning &quot;to turn aside&quot; or &quot;to depart,&quot; possibly indicating a place where travelers would stop or turn off the main road. ¶David, who had not authorized Abner's murder, mourned his death and publicly cursed Joab and his family for their treachery (2 Sam. 3:28-39). This incident highlights the complex political situation during the early years of David's reign and the challenges he faced in uniting the kingdom under his rule.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Sitnah is the name of a well that Isaac, the son of Abraham, dug in the Valley of Gerar during his sojourn in the land of the Philistines (Gen. 26:21). After the Philistines had stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug, Isaac began to reopen them. He also dug new wells, including one he named Sitnah. ¶The name &quot;Sitnah&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word &quot;satan,&quot; meaning &quot;accusation&quot; or &quot;enmity.&quot; This name was given to the well because the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming the water as their own. ¶The dispute over the well at Sitnah was part of a larger pattern of conflict between Isaac and the Philistines. The Philistines, envious of Isaac's prosperity, had stopped up the wells and sent him away (Gen. 26:14-16). Despite these challenges, Isaac persisted in his efforts to establish himself in the land, trusting in God's promise to bless him and his descendants. ¶The story of Isaac's wells, including Sitnah, illustrates the challenges faced by the patriarchs as they sought to maintain their presence in Canaan. It also highlights the importance of water rights in the semi-arid region and the potential for conflict over these valuable resources.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Smyrna was one of the seven churches of Asia Minor addressed in the Book of Revelation, known for its persecution and poverty, yet faithful to Christ (Rev. 1:11; 2:8-11).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Smyrna, modern-day Izmir in Turkey, was one of the seven churches of Asia Minor addressed in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:11). In the letter to the church of Smyrna, Jesus Christ acknowledges the church's suffering, poverty, and the blasphemy they faced from those who claimed to be Jews but were actually a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; (Rev. 2:9). ¶Despite their hardships, the church of Smyrna remained faithful to Christ. Jesus encourages them not to fear the impending persecution, which would include imprisonment and testing for &quot;ten days&quot; (Rev. 2:10). This may refer to a specific period of intense persecution or symbolize a limited time of trial. ¶Christ exhorts the church to remain faithful even unto death, promising them the &quot;crown of life&quot; as a reward for their steadfast endurance (Rev. 2:10). He also assures them that those who overcome will not be harmed by the &quot;second death,&quot; which is eternal separation from God (Rev. 2:11). ¶Smyrna was known for its beauty, commerce, and loyalty to Rome. It had a large Jewish population, which may have contributed to the persecution faced by the early Christian church there. The city was also a center of emperor worship, which likely created additional pressure for Christians who refused to participate in these pagan rituals. ¶The message to the church of Smyrna serves as an encouragement to all believers who face persecution and hardship for their faith. It reminds them that their ultimate loyalty is to Christ and that eternal life awaits those who remain faithful to Him.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Socoh, also spelled Sochoh or Shochoh, was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowlands, of Judah (Josh. 15:35). It is mentioned several times in the Bible, most notably in connection with the famous battle between David and Goliath. ¶In the account of David's confrontation with Goliath, the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh, while the Israelites camped in the Valley of Elah (1 Sam. 17:1). It was in this valley that David, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones, defeated the giant Goliath, leading to a great victory for Israel (1 Sam. 17:40-54). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Socoh was included in the district overseen by Ben-hesed, one of the twelve officers responsible for providing food for the king and his household (1 Ki. 4:10). ¶Later, when Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king, he fortified Socoh as part of his efforts to strengthen the defenses of Judah (2 Chr. 11:7). However, during the reign of King Ahaz, Socoh was among the towns captured by the Philistines (2 Chr. 28:18). ¶The exact location of Socoh is uncertain, but it is believed to be either Khirbet Abbad or Khirbet Shuweikeh, both located in the Shephelah region, approximately 15 miles southwest</ext_description>

It was one of the five &quot;cities of the plain&quot; (Gen. 14:2) and was closely associated with Gomorrah. God determined to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah due to their grave sins (Gen. 18:20), but Abraham pleaded with God to spare the city if even ten righteous people could be found (Gen. 18:22-33). However, not even ten were found, and God rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah, completely destroying them (Gen. 19:24-25). Lot and his daughters were the only survivors, as they were warned by angels to flee (Gen. 19:15-16). Sodom became a byword for wickedness and divine judgment (Deut. 29:23; Isa. 1:9-10; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46-56; Matt. 10:15; 11:23-24; Luke 17:29; Rom. 9:29; 2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 1:7; Rev. 11:8).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Solomon's Portico was a colonnade or covered walkway located on the east side of the temple complex in Jerusalem (Josephus, Antiquities 15.11.3). It was a place where people gathered, and where the apostles often met to teach and preach the gospel message after Pentecost. Notable events that occurred here include the healing of the lame man by Peter and John (Acts 3:11) and the gathering of the early believers (Acts 5:12).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Sorek Valley, the place where Delilah lived and where Samson's downfall began (Judg. 16:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>The Valley of Sorek was the place where Delilah, the woman who betrayed Samson, lived (Judg. 16:4). It was here that Samson fell in love with Delilah, who was eventually bribed by the Philistines to discover the secret of Samson's great strength. After three failed attempts, Delilah finally learned that Samson's strength was connected to his uncut hair, a symbol of his Nazirite vow (Judg. 16:15-17). She cut his hair while he slept, enabling the Philistines to capture him (Judg. 16:18-21). The exact location of the Sorek Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated somewhere in the territory of Judah, near Philistine territory.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Spain, a country Paul planned to visit to preach the gospel (Rom. 15:24, 28).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Spain is mentioned in the New Testament only in Paul's letter to the Romans. In Romans 15:24 and 28, Paul expresses his intention to visit Spain to preach the gospel after he has gone to Jerusalem to deliver the collection for the poor among the saints. It is unclear whether Paul ever fulfilled this intention, as there is no biblical record of him reaching Spain. However, some traditions suggest that Paul may have traveled to Spain after his first Roman imprisonment (1 Clement 5:7). At the time, Spain (Latin: Hispania) was a Roman province covering most of the Iberian Peninsula.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Straight was the name of a street in Damascus where Saul (later known as Paul) stayed in the house of a man named Judas after his dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:11). It was on this street that Ananias found Saul, as instructed by the Lord in a vision, and restored his sight. The Straight Street in Damascus is still known by this name today and is believed to follow the course of the ancient Roman road, the Via Recta, which ran from east to west through the city.</ext_description>

The location of Succoth is not certain, but it was likely situated in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the ancient city of Pithom (Tell el-Maskhuta). After leaving Succoth, the Israelites continued their journey and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness (Exod. 13:20; Num. 33:6).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Succoth was a city located in the territory allocated to the tribe of Gad in Canaan (Josh. 13:27). It is first mentioned as the place where Jacob built a house for himself and booths (Succoth) for his livestock after his meeting with Esau (Gen. 33:17). During the time of the judges, Gideon and his men pursued the Midianite kings to Succoth and requested provisions, but the officials of Succoth refused, leading to their punishment after the victory (Judg. 8:5-16). In the time of Solomon, Succoth was the location where the bronze works were made for the temple in Jerusalem, as it was situated in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan (1 Kgs. 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17). The city is also mentioned in Psalms 60:6 and 108:7 as part of a poetic description of God's dominion over the land.</ext_description>

Some scholars propose a connection between Suphah and the Red Sea (Yam Suph) based on the similarity of the names, but this remains speculative. The Book of the Wars of the Lord, which is not found in the current biblical canon, appears to have been an ancient source recording Israel's military campaigns during the wilderness wanderings.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Syracuse was an important city on the eastern coast of the island of Sicily. It is mentioned in Acts 28:12 as a place where the ship carrying Paul to Rome stopped for three days. The stop at Syracuse occurred after the ship had sailed from Malta, where Paul and the other passengers had been shipwrecked (Acts 28:1-11). Syracuse was founded by Greek colonists in the 8th century BC and became a significant center of Greek culture and commerce in the Mediterranean world. During the Roman period, Syracuse served as the capital of the province of Sicily. The brief mention of Syracuse in Acts provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions on their journey to Rome.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Syria, an ancient region north of Israel, often engaged in conflicts with Israel and Judah (1 Kgs. 20:1; 2 Kgs. 13:3).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Syria, also known as Aram, was an ancient region located north of Israel, with its capital at Damascus. Throughout the Old Testament, Syria frequently engaged in conflicts with Israel and Judah. During the reigns of Kings David and Solomon, Israel exerted control over parts of Syria (2 Sam. 8:5-6; 1 Chr. 18:5-6). However, in later years, Syrian kings often posed a threat to Israel and Judah, forming alliances against them (1 Kgs. 15:18-20; 2 Kgs. 16:5-9). The Arameans, the inhabitants of Syria, are mentioned as worshipping foreign gods (Judg. 10:6). In the New Testament, Syria is mentioned in connection with the spread of the gospel and the early church (Acts 15:23, 41; Gal. 1:21). The apostle Paul spent time in Syria during his missionary journeys (Acts 18:18; 21:3). A Syrophoenician woman is mentioned in Mark 7:26, highlighting Jesus' ministry in the region. Syria played a significant role in the history of Israel and the early church.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Syrtis is mentioned in Acts 27:17 as a dangerous area of shallow waters that sailors feared. As the ship carrying Paul to Rome was caught in a storm, the crew took measures to avoid being driven into the Syrtis. The Syrtis, also known as the Gulf of Sirte, is located off the coast of modern-day Libya in North Africa. It was notorious in ancient times for its shifting sand bars and treacherous currents, which could easily trap and wreck ships. The mention of Syrtis in the context of Paul's journey to Rome highlights the perils faced by sailors in the Mediterranean Sea during that time.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Taanach, also known as Aner, was a Canaanite city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Manasseh (Josh. 12:21; 17:11). However, the Manassites did not drive out the Canaanites from Taanach, and instead put them to forced labor (Judg. 1:27). Taanach was later designated as a Levitical city given to the Kohathite clan (Josh. 21:25; 1 Chr. 6:70). The city is mentioned in the song of Deborah as the site of a battle against the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera (Judg. 5:19). It was also included in the administrative district overseen by Baana, one of Solomon's twelve officers (1 Kgs. 4:12). The strategic location of Taanach, near the intersection of important trade routes, made it a significant city in the region.</ext_description>

The people complained against God, and in response, the Lord sent fire that consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. Moses interceded for the people, and the fire died down. The event at Taberah is cited as an example of the Israelites' rebellion and God's judgment during their wilderness wanderings.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Mount Tabor is a prominent mountain located in the Jezreel Valley of Israel. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, most notably in the account of Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera and the Canaanite army (Judg. 4:6-14). Deborah, a prophetess and judge, summoned Barak to gather troops from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun on Mount Tabor. From there, they descended to fight against Sisera's forces, and with God's help, they achieved a decisive victory. Mount Tabor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Zebulun (Josh. 19:22) and is praised for its beauty along with Mount Hermon in Psalm 89:12. The prophet Jeremiah uses Mount Tabor as a symbol of God's power and majesty (Jer. 46:18), while Hosea associates it with sites of idolatry and corruption (Hos. 5:1).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Tadmor (or Tamar), a city built by Solomon in the wilderness, possibly the later site of Palmyra (1 Kgs. 9:18; 2 Chr. 8:4).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Tadmor, also known as Tamar, was a city built by King Solomon in the wilderness. It is mentioned in 1 Kings 9:18 and 2 Chronicles 8:4. The name &quot;Tadmor&quot; is derived from the Semitic word for &quot;palm tree,&quot; while &quot;Tamar&quot; means &quot;date palm.&quot; The city's location in the wilderness suggests that it was situated in an oasis, possibly to serve as a trade center or a fortified outpost. Many scholars identify Tadmor with the later city of Palmyra, a prominent trading hub in the Syrian Desert during the Roman period. However, this identification remains uncertain. The construction of Tadmor demonstrates Solomon's efforts to expand his kingdom and control trade routes.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Tahpanhes (also known as Tehaphnehes or Tahapanes) was an important Egyptian city mentioned by the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. It was located in Lower Egypt, near the eastern border. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, Jewish refugees, including the prophet Jeremiah, fled to Tahpanhes (Jer. 43:7). Jeremiah prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would invade Egypt and bring destruction upon Tahpanhes and other Egyptian cities where the Jewish refugees had settled (Jer. 46:14). Ezekiel also foretold the destruction of Tahpanhes when Nebuchadnezzar would strike Egypt (Ezek. 30:18). The city was known for its large foreign population, including a garrison of Greek mercenaries established by Pharaoh Psammetichus I. Tahpanhes is also mentioned as a witness to the desolation of the cities of Judah (Jer. 44:1). The name &quot;Tahpanhes&quot; is of Egyptian origin and may mean &quot;Fortress of the Nubian&quot; or &quot;Fortress of Pinehas.&quot;</ext_description>

The city served as a boundary marker between the two tribes (Josh. 17:7-8). The name &quot;Tappuah&quot; means &quot;apple&quot; or &quot;apple tree,&quot; possibly indicating the presence of fruit trees in the area.

		<ext_description>Tarshish was a distant maritime city or region mentioned in various contexts throughout the Old Testament. It was known for its ships, which were used in long-distance trade (1 Kgs. 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21). The &quot;ships of Tarshish&quot; became a symbol of wealth and commercial power (Isa. 2:16; 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezek. 27:25). Tarshish was a source of silver, iron, tin, and lead (Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12). It was also associated with other distant and exotic locations, such as Sheba and Seba (Ps. 72:10). The exact location of Tarshish is uncertain, but many scholars believe it was situated in southern Spain, possibly near the ancient Phoenician colony of Tartessus. In the book of Jonah, the prophet attempts to flee from God's presence by sailing to Tarshish, emphasizing its distance from Israel (Jonah 1:3). The wealth and splendor of Tarshish are used as a metaphor for God's judgment (Isa. 23:6, 10; Ezek. 38:13). Despite its prominence, Tarshish would ultimately be subject to God's sovereignty (Ps. 48:7).</ext_description>

It is best known as the birthplace and early residence of the apostle Paul (Acts 22:3). Paul described himself as &quot;a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city&quot; (Acts 21:39), indicating Tarsus' significance and his own status as a citizen. After his conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul spent time in Tarsus (Acts 9:30) before being brought to Antioch by Barnabas (Acts 11:25). Tarsus was a center of Greek culture and learning, with a renowned university. It was also an important commercial hub, situated on major trade routes. The city's strategic location and cultural influence shaped Paul's background and prepared him for his future ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Tekoa was a town in the hill country of Judah, located about 10 miles south of Jerusalem. It is first mentioned as the birthplace of Ira, one of David's mighty men (2 Sam. 23:26; 1 Chr. 11:28). Tekoa was also the hometown of the wise woman who, at Joab's request, persuaded David to reconcile with his son Absalom (2 Sam. 14:2-9). During the reign of Rehoboam, Tekoa was fortified as part of Judah's defense system (2 Chr. 11:6). The town was the birthplace of the prophet Amos, who identified himself as &quot;one of the shepherds of Tekoa&quot; (Amos 1:1). Amos's rural background and proximity to the wilderness shaped his prophetic message. In the time of Jehoshaphat, the people of Judah gathered in the wilderness of Tekoa to seek God's help against their enemies (2 Chr. 20:20). The town was also involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Neh. 3:5, 27). Jeremiah mentioned Tekoa in his prophecy, urging the people to flee and sound the trumpet of warning (Jer. 6:1).</ext_description>

The name &quot;Tel-abib&quot; means &quot;mound of the flood&quot; or &quot;mound of the storm,&quot; possibly referring to the site's topography or its proximity to the river. Ezekiel received his prophetic visions and messages while residing in Tel-abib (Ezek. 1:1; 3:22-23). The Chebar River, near which Tel-abib was situated, was a major waterway in Babylonia, and several other Jewish settlements were located along its banks. The exiles in Tel-abib were among those deported from Judah by the Babylonians in the early 6th century BC. Ezekiel's presence and prophetic ministry in Tel-abib provided spiritual guidance and hope to the exiled community.</ext_description>

God had instructed Saul to completely destroy the Amalekites and their possessions (1 Sam. 15:1-3). Saul assembled an army of 200,000 men from Israel and 10,000 men from Judah at Telaim. The exact location of Telaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah, near the region inhabited by the Amalekites. After gathering his forces at Telaim, Saul proceeded to attack and defeat the Amalekites, but he disobeyed God's command by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the best livestock. This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king (1 Sam. 15:10-23).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Telassar, a Mesopotamian city conquered by the Assyrians, mentioned in the context of Sennacherib's boasting (2 Kgs. 19:12; Isa. 37:12).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Telassar is mentioned in 2 Kings 19:12 and Isaiah 37:12 as one of the cities conquered by the Assyrians. The context is a message sent by King Sennacherib of Assyria to King Hezekiah of Judah, boasting about the Assyrian victories over various cities and nations. Sennacherib mocks the gods of these conquered lands, including the gods of Telassar, claiming that they were unable to deliver their people from his hand. The exact location of Telassar is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in Mesopotamia, possibly in the region of the Tigris or Euphrates rivers. The name &quot;Telassar&quot; may be derived from the Akkadian language, meaning &quot;mound of Asshur&quot; or &quot;hill of Asshur,&quot; referring to the Assyrian deity. The mention of Telassar alongside other conquered cities serves to emphasize the extent of Assyrian power and their disregard for the gods of other nations.</ext_description>

In Job 6:19, the caravans of Tema are described as eagerly seeking water in the desert, highlighting the challenges of travel and commerce in the arid region. Isaiah 21:14 portrays the inhabitants of Tema offering assistance to fugitives and providing them with bread and water, suggesting a hospitable nature. Jeremiah 25:23 lists Tema among the Arabian tribes and kingdoms that would face God's judgment and be made to drink the cup of His wrath. The exact location of Tema is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, along the trade routes connecting Arabia with Mesopotamia and the Levant. The Tema oasis was a significant stopover for caravans, providing water and provisions for travelers. The tribe of Tema was likely involved in facilitating trade and offering protection to merchant caravans passing through their territory. The biblical references to Tema underscore the importance of Arabian trade and the interactions between the peoples of the Near East in ancient times.</ext_description>

It was the capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom period (1550-1070 BC). The city is mentioned in several prophetic passages in the Bible, primarily in the context of God's judgment against Egypt. Jeremiah prophesied that God would punish Amon, the chief deity of Thebes, along with Pharaoh and the people who trusted in him (Jer. 46:25). Ezekiel foretold the destruction of Thebes, stating that God would execute judgments against the city (Ezek. 30:14-16). Nahum used Thebes as an example of a mighty city that fell despite its strength and allies, comparing it to Nineveh (Nah. 3:8-10). The biblical references to Thebes highlight its prominence and influence in ancient times, as well as its vulnerability to God's judgment.</ext_description>

After Abimelech had captured Shechem and burned its tower, killing many people, he went to Thebez to besiege the city. During the attack, Abimelech approached the tower to set it on fire. However, a woman on the tower dropped an upper millstone on his head, crushing his skull. Abimelech then asked his armor-bearer to kill him with a sword, so that it would not be said that a woman had killed him. The incident at Thebez is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 11:21, when Joab rebuked David's messenger for getting too close to the wall during the siege of Rabbah, reminding him of Abimelech's fate at Thebez. The exact location of Thebez is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Shechem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Thessalonica was a major city in Macedonia, located on the Thermaic Gulf. It was an important commercial and political center during the Roman period. The apostle Paul visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, accompanied by Silas and Timothy (Acts 17:1-9). Paul preached in the synagogue for three Sabbaths, reasoning from the Scriptures about Jesus as the Messiah. Some Jews and a large number of God-fearing Greeks, including prominent women, believed and joined Paul and Silas. However, jealous Jews formed a mob and caused an uproar in the city, accusing Paul and Silas of defying Caesar's decrees. The believers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. Despite the opposition, a strong church was established in Thessalonica. Paul later wrote two epistles to the Thessalonian church, addressing their concerns and encouraging them in their faith (1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1). Thessalonica is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travels and ministry (Acts 20:4; 27:2; Phil. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:10).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Three Taverns (Latin: Tres Tabernae) was a staging post located on the Appian Way, approximately 33 miles (53 km) south of Rome. It was situated near the junction of the Appian Way and a side road leading to Antium (modern-day Anzio). The name &quot;Three Taverns&quot; suggests that it served as a rest stop and a place of lodging for travelers. When the apostle Paul was being escorted to Rome as a prisoner, some Christians from Rome journeyed to meet him at Three Taverns and the Forum of Appius (Acts 28:15). This gesture of support and fellowship likely encouraged Paul as he faced an uncertain future in the imperial capital. The fact that the Roman Christians were willing to travel a considerable distance to meet Paul testifies to his reputation and the esteem in which he was held by the early church.</ext_description>

She encountered the apostle Paul in Philippi and became a convert to Christianity (Acts 16:14-15). Thyatira is also mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:11). In the letter to the church in Thyatira, the risen Christ commends the believers for their love, faith, service, and patient endurance (Rev. 2:18-19). However, he also rebukes them for tolerating a false prophetess, symbolically referred to as &quot;Jezebel,&quot; who promoted sexual immorality and idolatry (Rev. 2:20-23). The faithful in Thyatira are encouraged to hold fast until Christ's return, with the promise of authority over the nations for those who overcome (Rev. 2:24-28).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Tibhath is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 18:8 as one of the cities from which King David took a large amount of bronze (copper or brass) after defeating Hadadezer, king of Zobah. The bronze was later used by Solomon in the construction of the Temple, specifically for making the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles (1 Chr. 18:8). The parallel passage in 2 Samuel 8:8 refers to the city as &quot;Betah.&quot; The exact location of Tibhath is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Zobah, a kingdom to the north of Israel, in the area of modern-day Syria. The acquisition of bronze from Tibhath demonstrates David's military successes and his preparation for the future construction of the Temple, a task that would be completed by his son Solomon.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Tigris River is one of the four rivers mentioned in the biblical account of the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:14). It is described as flowing from Eden, along with the Euphrates, Pishon, and Gihon. The Tigris and Euphrates are the two major rivers of Mesopotamia, and their identification is certain. In the Book of Daniel, the Tigris River is mentioned as the location where Daniel received a vision (Dan. 10:4). Daniel, who had been exiled to Babylon, was standing on the bank of the Tigris when he saw a man dressed in linen and heard a message concerning future events. The Tigris River originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and flows through Iraq before joining the Euphrates to form the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. The river was important for ancient civilizations such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, providing water for irrigation and serving as a major transportation route.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Timnah, a Canaanite city on the border between Judah and Dan, associated with Judah's son Er and Samson (Gen. 38:12-14; Josh. 15:10; 19:43; Judg. 14:1-5).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Timnah was a Canaanite city located on the border between the territories of Judah and Dan. It is first mentioned in the story of Judah and Tamar, where Judah's son Er was married to Tamar (Gen. 38:12-14). Later, during the conquest of Canaan, Timnah was allocated to the tribe of Dan (Josh. 19:43) but was also mentioned as part of Judah's territory (Josh. 15:10). In the time of the judges, Samson went down to Timnah and fell in love with a Philistine woman, whom he desired to marry (Judg. 14:1-5). The city was later captured by the Philistines during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah (2 Chr. 28:18). Timnah was situated in the Sorek Valley, known for its fertile land and strategic location on trade routes. ¶The Timnites are mentioned in Judges 15:6 as the people of the Philistine city of Timnah. Samson, one of the judges of Israel, had married a Philistine woman from Timnah. However, during the wedding feast, Samson posed a riddle to the Philistine guests, which they could not solve. They threatened Samson's wife to reveal the answer, which she did. In anger, Samson killed thirty Philistine men and left his wife. Later, when Samson attempted to visit his wife, he discovered that her father had given her to another man. In revenge, Samson burned the Philistines' fields, vineyards, and olive groves. The Timnites retaliated by burning Samson's wife and her father to death. This escalated the conflict between Samson and the Philistines.</ext_description>

The name &quot;Timnath-heres&quot; means &quot;portion of the sun,&quot; while &quot;Timnath-serah&quot; means &quot;portion of abundance.&quot; Joshua built the city and settled there (Josh. 19:50). After Joshua's death, he was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres (Judg. 2:9; Josh. 24:30). The town became a symbol of Joshua's leadership and faithfulness in serving the Lord throughout his life. Its location is believed to be at modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, approximately 20 miles southwest of Shechem.</ext_description>

The city was located on the western bank of the Euphrates River, in the region of northern Syria or southern Turkey. Its inclusion in the description of Solomon's realm demonstrates the vast extent of his dominion and influence during the height of his reign. Tiphsah's strategic position on the Euphrates made it an important trade and military center, allowing Solomon to control the major trade routes between Mesopotamia and the Levant. The city's location also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would possess the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates (Gen. 15:18).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Tiphsah is mentioned in 2 Kings 15:16 as a city that was attacked by Menahem, king of Israel, during his reign. This Tiphsah is likely a different city from the one mentioned in 1 Kings 4:24, as it seems to be located within the territory of Israel rather than on the Euphrates River. The biblical text records that Menahem attacked Tiphsah and its surrounding territory, brutally conquering the city and ripping open the pregnant women. This act of cruelty was likely intended to terrorize the population and suppress any potential rebellion against Menahem's rule. The exact location of this Tiphsah is uncertain, but it may have been situated in the northern part of Israel, possibly near the border with Syria.</ext_description>

Tirzah served as the royal residence and administrative center until Omri built Samaria, which then became the new capital (1 Kgs. 16:23-24). The city is also mentioned in the Song of Solomon, where the beauty of the Shulammite woman is likened to that of Tirzah (Song 6:4).

In Tob, Jephthah gathered a group of worthless men who followed him, possibly serving as mercenaries. When the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead sought out Jephthah in the land of Tob and requested that he lead them in battle (Judg. 11:5-6). Jephthah agreed and successfully defeated the Ammonites. The region of Tob is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 10:6, 8, where the Ammonites hired mercenaries from Tob to fight against King David's army. The exact location of Tob is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Gilead, near the border with Syria.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Tolad is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 4:29 as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Simeon during the division of the Promised Land. It is listed along with other Simeonite towns such as Balah, Ezem, and Bethuel. The exact location of Tolad is unknown, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, in the southern part of Judah's territory. In Joshua 19:4, a town named El-tolad is mentioned among the towns given to Simeon, which may be the same as Tolad. </ext_description>

		<short_description>Tophel, a location mentioned in Moses' speech to the Israelites, possibly near modern-day et-Tafeleh, southeast of the Dead Sea (Deut. 1:1).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Tophel is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Deuteronomy 1:1, as one of the places near where Moses delivered his final address to the Israelites before they entered the Promised Land. The exact location of Tophel is uncertain, but it is described as being in the wilderness, in the Arabah, opposite Suph, between Paran, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. Some scholars suggest that Tophel may be identified with modern-day et-Tafeleh, a village located about 15 miles southeast of the Dead Sea, on the caravan route between Petra and Kerak. However, this identification is not conclusive. The mention of Tophel in the context of Moses' speech serves to provide a geographical reference point for the location of the Israelite camp at the time of the address.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Topheth, located in the Valley of Hinnom (also called the Valley of Slaughter or Baca Valley) south of Jerusalem, was a site of pagan child sacrifice that was defiled by King Josiah (2 Kgs 23:10; Jer 7:31-32; 19:2, 6, 11-14; 32:35; Isa 30:33).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Topheth was a place located in the Valley of Hinnom (also known as the Valley of Slaughter or Baca Valley), south of Jerusalem, where pagan child sacrifices were performed (2 Kgs 23:10; Jer 7:31-32; 19:2, 6, 11-14; 32:35; Isa 30:33). The name &quot;Topheth&quot; is believed to derive from the Hebrew word for &quot;fireplace&quot; or &quot;hearth,&quot; indicating its association with burning. The Valley of Hinnom was used as a burial ground (Jer 19:11) and a place of idolatrous worship, where people burned their children as offerings to the Canaanite god Molech (2 Chr 28:3; 33:6). King Josiah defiled Topheth to put an end to these practices (2 Kgs 23:10). The valley became a symbol of divine judgment and a metaphor for hell (Isa 30:33). In the New Testament, the Greek word &quot;Gehenna,&quot; derived from &quot;Valley of Hinnom,&quot; is used to refer to the place of eternal punishment (Matt 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; Jas 3:6).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Tower of Eder, also known as the Tower of the Flock, is mentioned twice in the Bible. In Genesis 35:21, it is recorded that Jacob pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder after the death of his wife, Rachel. The tower was likely a watchtower used by shepherds to guard their flocks near Bethlehem. In Micah 4:8, the prophet addresses the Tower of the Flock, associating it with the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of the kingdom to Jerusalem. This passage has led some interpreters to view the Tower of Eder as a prophetic symbol of the birthplace of the Messiah, linking it to the fields near Bethlehem where the shepherds received the announcement of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:8-20). However, the exact location of the tower and its significance in Messianic prophecy remain a matter of interpretation.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Tower of Hananel was a prominent tower located in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the context of the city's rebuilding and restoration. In Nehemiah 3:1 and 12:39, it is recorded that the tower was rebuilt by the high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests during the reconstruction of Jerusalem's walls in the time of Nehemiah. The tower was likely situated on the northern side of the city, near the Sheep Gate and the Fish Gate. The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah also mention the Tower of Hananel in their visions of Jerusalem's future restoration and expansion (Jer. 31:38; Zech. 14:10). In these prophetic passages, the tower serves as a boundary marker, indicating the extent of the city's rebuilding and the scope of God's blessing upon Jerusalem. The Tower of Hananel thus stands as a symbol of Jerusalem's strength, security, and future hope in the prophetic literature.</ext_description>

The name &quot;Trachonitis&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;trachon,&quot; meaning &quot;a rugged or stony place.&quot; In the New Testament, Trachonitis is mentioned only once, in Luke 3:1, where it is described as part of the tetrarchy of Philip, along with Ituraea, during the time of John the Baptist's ministry. The region was known for its caves, which were often used as hideouts by robbers. Herod the Great had previously routed out these robbers to maintain order in the area. After Philip's death, Trachonitis was briefly annexed to the province of Syria before being given to Agrippa I by Caligula. The exact boundaries of Trachonitis are not clearly defined in the Bible, but it is generally associated with the modern-day Leja' region in southern Syria.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Valley of the Travelers, also known as the Valley of the Passengers, is mentioned in Ezekiel 39:11 in the context of the prophesied defeat of Gog and his army. According to the prophecy, after God defeats Gog and his forces, the Israelites will bury them in the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea. The burial of Gog's army will be so extensive that it will block the path of travelers passing through the valley, hence its name. The exact location of this valley is not specified, but it is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea. The burial of Gog's army in the Valley of the Travelers serves as a symbol of God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people, and it will take seven months for the Israelites to cleanse the land by burying the dead (Ezek. 39:12-16).</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Troas, also known as Alexandria Troas, was a city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), near the site of ancient Troy. The city was an important seaport and a significant center for trade and commerce. In the New Testament, Troas is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's missionary journeys. During his second missionary journey, Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia pleading with him to come and help them while he was in Troas (Acts 16:8-10). This vision prompted Paul and his companions to sail from Troas to Macedonia, marking a significant expansion of the gospel into Europe. Later, during his third missionary journey, Paul spent a week in Troas, where he preached late into the night (Acts 20:5-12). During this visit, a young man named Eutychus fell asleep and fell from a window, but Paul raised him back to life. Paul also visited Troas on other occasions (2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13), indicating the city's importance as a strategic location for his ministry.</ext_description>

The town was located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), near the city of Ephesus. After leaving Troas, Paul and his companions sailed to Assos, where Paul boarded the ship. They then sailed past Mitylene and arrived at Chios. The following day, they crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day, they reached Miletus, where Paul summoned the elders of the Ephesian church to give them a farewell address (Acts 20:17-38). The mention of Trogyllium in the itinerary of Paul's journey highlights the coastal route he took as he traveled to Jerusalem, stopping at various cities along the way to minister to the churches and strengthen the believers.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Tubal, a nation descended from Japheth, known for trading in slaves and bronze, and allied with Gog in the prophecy of Ezekiel (Gen. 10:2; Isa. 66:19; Ezek. 27:13; 38:2-3; 39:1).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Tubal is mentioned in the Bible as a nation descended from Tubal, one of the sons of Japheth (Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5). The Tubal people are associated with the Meshech people, and together they are known for their trading activities, particularly in slaves and bronze (Ezek. 27:13). In the prophecy of Ezekiel, Tubal is mentioned along with Meshech as one of the nations allied with Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal (Ezek. 38:2-3; 39:1). Gog and his allies, including Tubal, are prophesied to attack Israel in the latter days but will ultimately be defeated by God. The exact location of Tubal is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of eastern Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the southern Caucasus. Some scholars identify Tubal with the Tabali, a people group mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions. In Isaiah 66:19, Tubal is listed among the distant nations to which God will send survivors to proclaim His glory, suggesting that the Tubal people will also have an opportunity to hear and respond to the message of salvation.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Tyre, a prominent Phoenician port city, known for its wealth, trade, and craftsmanship, often mentioned in the context of judgment and prophecy (Josh. 19:29; 2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kgs. 5:1; Isa. 23:1-17; Ezek. 26-28; Matt. 11:21-22; Acts 12:20).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Tyre was a major Phoenician port city located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its wealth, trade, and skilled craftsmen. The city is first mentioned in the Bible as part of the boundary of the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:29). Tyre's king, Hiram, provided cedar, cypress timber, and skilled workers to David for his palace (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1) and to Solomon for the construction of the Temple (1 Kgs. 5:1; 9:11-12; 2 Chr. 2:3-16). Despite this friendly relationship, Tyre is often denounced by the prophets for its pride, idolatry, and oppression of God's people (Isa. 23; Jer. 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezek. 26-28; Amos 1:9-10). Ezekiel prophesied the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar (Ezek. 26) and its eventual restoration and dedication of its wealth to God (Isa. 23:17-18). In the New Testament, Jesus visited the region of Tyre and Sidon and performed miracles there (Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24-31). He also used Tyre and Sidon as examples of cities that would have repented if they had witnessed the miracles performed in Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21-22; Luke 10:13-14). The apostle Paul visited Tyre during his missionary journeys (Acts 21:3-7). Throughout the Bible, Tyre is portrayed as a symbol of wealth, trade, and worldly influence, often contrasted with the values of God's kingdom.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Ulai is a river mentioned in the Book of Daniel, located in the ancient region of Elam, near the city of Susa (Dan. 8:2). In Daniel's vision, he finds himself beside the Ulai Canal, where he sees a ram with two horns standing beside the river (Dan. 8:3). The ram is later interpreted as representing the kings of Media and Persia (Dan. 8:20). As the vision continues, Daniel sees a male goat coming from the west, which defeats the ram (Dan. 8:5-7). The goat is interpreted as the king of Greece (Dan. 8:21). The Ulai River is mentioned again when the angel Gabriel approaches Daniel to explain the vision (Dan. 8:16). The river's location in Elam, combined with the mention of Susa, suggests that the Ulai may be associated with the ancient city of Susa, which served as one of the capitals of the Persian Empire. The Ulai River is thus connected with important prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel, which foretell the rise and fall of major world empires and their impact on God's people.</ext_description>

No further information is provided about the town in the Bible, and its history and significance remain largely unknown.

		<ext_description>Uphaz is mentioned twice in the Bible as a place known for its fine gold. In Jeremiah 10:9, the prophet describes the idols of the nations as being adorned with gold from Uphaz and silver from Tarshish, emphasizing the precious materials used in their construction. In Daniel 10:5, the prophet Daniel has a vision of a man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with gold from Uphaz. The use of gold from Uphaz in both passages suggests that it was highly valued and associated with wealth and luxury. The exact location of Uphaz is uncertain, and some scholars believe it may be a variant spelling or a copyist's error for Ophir, another region famous for its gold in the Bible (1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:11; 22:48; 1 Chr. 29:4; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10; Job 22:24; 28:16; Ps. 45:9; Isa. 13:12). However, others maintain that Uphaz was a distinct place, possibly located in the Arabian Peninsula or the Near East, known for its high-quality gold. Regardless of its exact location, the mention of Uphaz in the Bible underscores the importance and value placed on gold in ancient Near Eastern cultures.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ur, also known as Ur of the Chaldeans, was an ancient city located in southern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. It is best known as the hometown of Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites. According to Genesis, Abraham (then called Abram) lived in Ur with his father Terah, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot (Gen. 11:28-31). God called Abraham to leave Ur and go to the land of Canaan, promising to make him a great nation and a blessing to all the families of the earth (Gen. 12:1-3). Abraham obeyed and set out from Ur, traveling first to Haran and then to Canaan (Gen. 11:31; 12:4-5). Later, when God confirms His covenant with Abraham, He reminds him that He brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give him the land of Canaan (Gen. 15:7). The city of Ur is also mentioned in Nehemiah 9:7, where the Levites recount God's faithfulness in bringing Abraham out of Ur and making a covenant with him. Archaeologists have identified the ancient city of Ur with modern-day Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq, which was once a thriving center of Sumerian civilization. The biblical account of Abraham's origins in Ur highlights God's sovereign plan in calling and guiding His chosen people from the very beginning.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Uz is a region mentioned in the Bible, most prominently as the homeland of Job, the righteous man whose faith was tested through great suffering (Job 1:1). The exact location of Uz is uncertain, but it is believed to be situated east of the land of Israel and Edom, possibly in northern Arabia or southern Jordan. Job's story describes Uz as a place near the desert (Job 1:19) but also fertile for farming and raising livestock (Job 1:3, 14; 42:12). The people of Uz are referred to as &quot;the people of the East&quot; (Job 1:3), and the land was vulnerable to Chaldean raiding parties (Job 1:17). Uz is also mentioned in Jeremiah 25:20 among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath, and in Lamentations 4:21, where Edom is addressed as dwelling in the land of Uz. Some scholars propose that Uz may be a fictional place serving the story of Job rather than a physical land, with the name &quot;Uz&quot; in Hebrew meaning &quot;counsel&quot; or &quot;advice.&quot;</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Uzal is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Ezekiel 27:19, as part of a prophecy against Tyre. In this passage, Ezekiel lists various nations and regions that traded with Tyre, including Dan, Javan, and Uzal. The verse states that these places traded &quot;wrought iron, cassia, and calamus&quot; in Tyre's marketplace. The exact location of Uzal is uncertain, but some scholars believe it may refer to a region in Arabia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Sanaa in modern-day Yemen. Other interpretations suggest that Uzal could be a reference to a type of high-quality sword or blade, rather than a geographical location. The mention of Uzal in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre and the various commodities exchanged in the ancient Near East.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Uzza is mentioned in the Bible as a garden in Jerusalem where two kings of Judah, Manasseh and his son Amon, were buried (2 Kgs. 21:18, 26). Manasseh, who reigned for 55 years, was known for his wickedness and idolatry, leading the people of Judah astray (2 Kgs. 21:1-9). However, after being captured by the Assyrians, Manasseh repented and sought the Lord (2 Chr. 33:10-13). Upon his return to Jerusalem, he attempted to undo some of the damage caused by his earlier actions (2 Chr. 33:14-16). After Manasseh's death, he was buried in his own house, in the garden of Uzza (2 Kgs. 21:18). Amon, Manasseh's son, succeeded him as king but continued in the evil ways of his father's earlier reign. After ruling for only two years, Amon was assassinated by his servants and was also buried in the garden of Uzza (2 Kgs. 21:19-26). The exact location of the garden of Uzza is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely a royal garden or burial ground near the king's palace in Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Uzzen-sheerah, a town built by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim, along with the towns of Upper and Lower Beth-horon (1 Chr. 7:24).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Uzzen-sheerah is mentioned briefly in 1 Chronicles 7:24 as a town built by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim. The passage states that Sheerah built the towns of Upper and Lower Beth-horon, as well as Uzzen-sheerah. This information is provided in the context of the genealogy of the tribe of Ephraim, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The name &quot;Uzzen-sheerah&quot; likely means &quot;the ear of Sheerah,&quot; possibly referring to a geographical feature or a place named in honor of Sheerah. The exact location of Uzzen-sheerah is not specified in the Bible, but it was probably situated in the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. The mention of Sheerah as the builder of these towns is notable, as it is unusual for women to be credited with such accomplishments in the biblical record. This brief reference to Uzzen-sheerah provides insight into the development and settlement of the land by the Israelites following their conquest of Canaan.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Valley Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Bible in connection with the city's fortifications and rebuilding. In 2 Chronicles 26:9, it is recorded that King Uzziah of Judah built towers at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle of the wall, strengthening Jerusalem's defenses. The Valley Gate is also prominently mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which describes the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls after the Babylonian exile. Nehemiah inspected the Valley Gate during his nighttime survey of the city's damaged walls (Neh. 2:13, 15). Later, during the rebuilding process, Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, including its doors, bolts, and bars (Neh. 3:13). The exact location of the Valley Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the western side of Jerusalem, leading to the Hinnom Valley. The Valley Gate's mention in both historical and post-exilic accounts highlights its importance in the defense and security of Jerusalem throughout different periods of the city's history.</ext_description>

The verse mentions Vedan and Javan as trading with yarn for Tyre's wares. The exact location of Vedan is unknown, and the text is considered to be in poor condition. Some scholars suggest that Vedan may be a reference to Dedan, which is mentioned separately in the following verse. Others propose that Vedan could be identified with Waddan, also known as al-'Abwa', a location between Mecca and Medina. However, these identifications remain speculative due to the lack of clear evidence. The mention of Vedan in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre and the various places that engaged in commerce with the city.</ext_description>

The verse is part of a quotation from the &quot;Book of the Wars of the Lord,&quot; an ancient source that is no longer extant. The passage reads, &quot;Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon.&quot; The exact location of Waheb is unknown, but it is mentioned alongside the valleys of the Arnon, suggesting that it may have been situated in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. Some scholars propose that &quot;Waheb&quot; may not be a place name but rather a verb meaning &quot;to give&quot; or &quot;to destroy.&quot; However, the lack of additional context makes it difficult to determine the precise meaning of the term. The reference to Waheb in the Book of Numbers provides a glimpse into the geographical and historical details of Israel's wilderness journey, even though the exact nature of the place remains uncertain.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Washer's Field, also known as the Fuller's Field, is a location mentioned in the Bible in connection with the walls of Jerusalem and prophetic messages. In 2 Kings 18:17 and Isaiah 36:2, it is recorded that the Assyrian king Sennacherib sent his officials, the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh, to deliver a message to King Hezekiah of Judah. They stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer's Field, and called for the king. The Washer's Field was likely an area outside the city walls where launderers washed and dried clothes, taking advantage of the water supply from the nearby pool. The prophet Isaiah also mentions the Washer's Field in an earlier prophecy (Isa. 7:3), where God instructs him to meet King Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Washer's Field, to deliver a message of reassurance concerning the impending Assyrian threat. The Washer's Field's location near the city walls and its association with important prophetic messages and diplomatic encounters highlight its significance in the biblical narrative.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Water Gate was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah in connection with the city's rebuilding and spiritual renewal. During the reconstruction of Jerusalem's walls, the Nethinim (temple servants) and the merchants made repairs on the wall as far as the Water Gate (Neh. 3:26). Later, when Ezra the scribe read the Book of the Law to the people, he did so in the square before the Water Gate (Neh. 8:1, 3). The people listened attentively and responded with worship and repentance. During the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles, the people gathered at the Water Gate to hear the Law read and to celebrate the feast (Neh. 8:16). The Water Gate is also mentioned in the description of the dedication of the rebuilt wall, where two choirs proceeded along the wall in opposite directions, with one group going past the Water Gate (Neh. 12:37). The exact location of the Water Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern side of Jerusalem, near the Gihon Spring, which provided a vital water source for the city. The Water Gate's association with the reading of the Law and the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles emphasizes its importance as a place of spiritual renewal and community gathering in post-exilic Jerusalem.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Way of Holiness is a prophetic concept mentioned in Isaiah 35:8, describing a future highway that will be established for the redeemed of the Lord. The verse reads, &quot;A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for others. Whoever walks the road, although a fool, shall not go astray.&quot; This highway is depicted as a place of safety and purity, accessible only to those who are righteous and redeemed. It is a path that leads to Zion, symbolizing the journey of God's people to His presence and blessing. The Way of Holiness is part of a broader prophetic vision in Isaiah 35, which describes the restoration and transformation of creation, the healing of the blind, deaf, lame, and mute, and the joy of the redeemed as they return to Zion (Isa. 35:1-10). This vision points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His kingdom, where holiness and righteousness will prevail. The Way of Holiness represents the path of faith, obedience, and trust in God, which leads to eternal life and fellowship with Him.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Wildgoats Rocks is a location mentioned in 1 Samuel 24:2 as a place where David and his men sought refuge while fleeing from King Saul. The area is described as being near En Gedi, a lush oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Saul, having returned from pursuing the Philistines, took 3,000 chosen men to search for David and his men in the Wildgoats Rocks region. While Saul was in a cave relieving himself, David had the opportunity to cut off a corner of the king's robe, demonstrating his loyalty and respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed. The rugged terrain of Wildgoats Rocks provided numerous hiding places for David and his men, making it difficult for Saul to locate them. The name &quot;Wildgoats Rocks&quot; likely refers to the rugged, steep cliffs in the area, which are suitable habitats for wild goats. This incident in the Wildgoats Rocks demonstrates David's integrity and faith in God's plan for his life, as he refused to harm Saul, even when presented with the opportunity.</ext_description>

During the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, Jehoiada, the son of Paseah, and Meshullam, the son of Besodeiah, repaired the Yeshanah Gate (Neh. 3:6). They laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars. The Yeshanah Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:39, where it is listed among the gates and landmarks along the route of the dedication procession for the rebuilt walls. The exact location of the Yeshanah Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the northern side of Jerusalem. The name &quot;Yeshanah&quot; means &quot;old&quot; in Hebrew, suggesting that this gate may have been one of the older entrances to the city or that it led to an older part of Jerusalem.

The prophet Micah declares, &quot;Pass by in naked shame, you inhabitant of Shaphir; the inhabitant of Zaanan does not go out. Beth Ezel mourns; its place to stand is taken away from you.&quot; The exact location of Zaanan is uncertain, but based on the context of Micah's prophecy, it was likely situated in the Shephelah, the lowland region between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. The name &quot;Zaanan&quot; is derived from the Hebrew word meaning &quot;to go out&quot; or &quot;to come forth,&quot; which may be a wordplay on the town's failure to come to the aid of its neighbors during a time of crisis. Micah's prophecy against Zaanan and the other towns in the region underscores the judgment and consequences that would come upon Judah for their unfaithfulness to God and their lack of justice and righteousness.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zaanannim is a place mentioned twice in the Bible, once in Joshua 19:33 and again in Judges 4:11. In Joshua 19:33, Zaanannim is described as being near Kedesh, a city in the territory of Naphtali, in the northern part of Canaan. The verse mentions Zaanannim as part of the boundary description for the allotment of land to the tribe of Naphtali. In Judges 4:11, Zaanannim is associated with the Kenites, a nomadic tribe that was friendly to the Israelites. The verse states that Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanannim. This reference to Zaanannim occurs in the context of the story of Deborah and Barak, who led the Israelites in a battle against Sisera, the commander of King Jabin's army. Heber's wife, Jael, would later kill Sisera by driving a tent peg through his temple as he slept (Judg. 4:17-22). The exact location of Zaanannim is not certain, but its association with Kedesh and the Kenites suggests that it was situated in the northern region of Israel, near the border with Syria.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zalmonah, a campsite of the Israelites during their wilderness journey, located between Mount Hor and Punon (Num. 33:41-42).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zalmonah was one of the places where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey after leaving Egypt. It is mentioned in Numbers 33:41-42 as part of the itinerary recorded in the Book of Numbers. The Israelites arrived at Zalmonah after departing from Mount Hor and before moving on to Punon. The exact location of Zalmonah is unknown, but it was situated somewhere between Mount Hor, where Aaron died (Num. 20:22-29), and Punon, another campsite mentioned only in the itinerary. No other details about Zalmonah are provided in the Bible, and the site is not mentioned in any other context. The inclusion of Zalmonah in the list of Israel's campsites highlights the detailed record-keeping of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and their numerous stops along the way.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zanoah was a town located in the Judean lowlands (Shephelah) that was allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land (Josh. 15:34). It is mentioned in the genealogy of Judah, where it is associated with Jekuthiel, the father of Zanoah (1 Chr. 4:18). During the time of Nehemiah, the people of Zanoah played a significant role in rebuilding the Valley Gate and a section of the wall of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:13). They are also listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after the Babylonian exile (Neh. 11:30). The exact location of Zanoah is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated in the Shephelah region, known for its fertile valleys and strategic importance. The repeated mention of Zanoah in various contexts throughout the Bible highlights its significance as a town within the territory of Judah.</ext_description>

This Zanoah is distinct from the Zanoah mentioned in Joshua 15:34, which was located in the Judean lowlands (Shephelah). The exact location of the hill country Zanoah is not specified in the Bible, but it was situated within the tribal territory of Judah, in the central highlands of Canaan. No further information about this Zanoah is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other context. The inclusion of Zanoah in the list of Judah's hill country towns demonstrates the thoroughness of the biblical record in documenting the allotment of the land to the tribes of Israel, even when mentioning relatively obscure places.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zaphon has two distinct meanings in the Bible. First, it is the name of a city allotted to the tribe of Gad in the division of the Promised Land (Josh. 13:27). This city was located in the Jordan Valley, near the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee). Second, Zaphon is used as a term for the north or the heavenly dwelling place of God. In Psalm 48:2, Mount Zion is described as being &quot;in the far north,&quot; using the term &quot;Zaphon&quot; to emphasize its sacred status. In Isaiah 14:13, the king of Babylon is portrayed as aspiring to ascend to heaven and sit on the mount of assembly &quot;in the far reaches of the north&quot; (Zaphon), symbolizing his desire to usurp God's authority. The term &quot;Zaphon&quot; is also mentioned in Judges 12:1, where the Ephraimites gathered in Zaphon before confronting Jephthah. The dual usage of Zaphon in the Bible highlights the interplay between physical locations and spiritual symbolism in the biblical narrative.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zarephath, also known as Sarepta, was a Phoenician city located between Tyre and Sidon on the Mediterranean coast. The city is most notably mentioned in the Bible in connection with the prophet Elijah. During a severe famine, God directed Elijah to go to Zarephath, where he had commanded a widow to provide for him (1 Kgs. 17:9). Upon arriving at the city gate, Elijah met the widow and asked her for water and bread. Despite her limited resources, the widow shared her last meal with Elijah, and as a result, her flour and oil miraculously never ran out until the end of the famine (1 Kgs. 17:10-16). Later, when the widow's son fell ill and died, Elijah prayed to God and raised the boy back to life (1 Kgs. 17:17-24). In the New Testament, Jesus references Elijah's stay in Zarephath as an example of God's grace extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles (Luke 4:26). The city is also mentioned in the Book of Obadiah, where it is prophesied that the exiles of Israel will possess the land as far as Zarephath (Obad. 1:20). Zarephath's significance in the Bible lies in its connection to Elijah's ministry and its role in demonstrating God's power and provision.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zarethan, also known by various spellings such as Zaretan, Zartanah, Zererah, and Zeredah, is a place mentioned in the Bible in connection with several significant events. It is first mentioned in Joshua 3:16 as a location near Adam where the waters of the Jordan River were cut off, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. Later, in the account of Gideon's pursuit of the Midianites, Zarethan is mentioned as a point of reference (Judg. 7:22). During the reign of Solomon, Zarethan is noted as the place where Hiram, a Phoenician craftsman, cast bronze implements for the Temple in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan (1 Kgs. 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17). The city is also mentioned in 1 Kings 4:12 to help locate Beth-Shean, which was in Solomon's fifth administrative district. Although the exact location of Zarethan is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated in the Jordan Valley, possibly on the west bank of the river. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Mazar (also known as Qerawa or Korea) near Mount Sartabe, while others suggest it may have been on the east bank. Regardless of its precise location, Zarethan played a role in significant events in Israel's history, from the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to the construction of Solomon's Temple.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zeboiim was one of the five cities of the plain, along with Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zoar, located in the area now covered by the Dead Sea. It is first mentioned in Genesis 10:19 as part of the description of the territory of Canaan, extending from Sidon to Gaza and then eastward toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim. In Genesis 14, Zeboiim is listed among the cities that rebelled against Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allies after serving them for twelve years. The king of Zeboiim, along with the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Bela (Zoar), engaged in battle against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Valley of Siddim but were defeated (Gen. 14:2, 8-10). Later, when God determined to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Zeboiim was also included in the destruction (Deut. 29:23). The prophet Hosea, in a message of judgment against Israel, refers to Zeboiim along with Admah as examples of God's punishment, emphasizing the severity of Israel's impending judgment (Hos. 11:8). The destruction of Zeboiim, along with the other cities of the plain, serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent wickedness and disobedience to God.</ext_description>

This Zeboim is distinct from the ancient city of Zeboiim that was destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah. In the context of Nehemiah 11, the resettlement of towns and villages surrounding Jerusalem is described, with people from Judah and Benjamin inhabiting these places. Zeboim is listed among other towns such as Hadid, Neballat, Lod, and Ono, suggesting that it was located in the region of Judah, possibly in the Shephelah (lowlands) or the coastal plain. The mention of Zeboim in this passage highlights the efforts of the returning exiles to reestablish their presence in the land and rebuild their communities after the Babylonian captivity. However, no further details about this specific town are provided in the Bible.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Valley of Zeboim is mentioned in 1 Samuel 13:18 as one of the destinations of the Philistine raiding parties sent out from their camp at Michmash during the reign of King Saul. The passage describes three groups of raiders: one turned toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, another toward Beth-horon, and the third toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness. The exact location of the Valley of Zeboim is uncertain, but based on the context, it is believed to have been situated somewhere east of Michmash, possibly in the wilderness region near the Dead Sea. The name &quot;Zeboim&quot; may be related to the ancient city of Zeboiim, one of the cities of the plain destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah, although a direct connection is not certain. The mention of the Valley of Zeboim in this passage provides insight into the geography of the region and the military activities of the Philistines during Saul's reign, as they sought to assert their control over the territory of Israel.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zedad is a place name that appears twice in the Bible, both times in the context of describing the boundaries of the Promised Land. In Numbers 34:8, as part of the instructions given to Moses regarding the division of the land, Zedad is mentioned as a point on the northern border, following the entrance of Hamath. The border was to extend from Mount Hor to the entrance of Hamath and then to Zedad. In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel (Ezek. 47:15), Zedad is again mentioned as part of the northern border, along with the entrance of Hamath and Berothah. The exact location of Zedad is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Hamath, north of Damascus in modern-day Syria. Its mention in both the Mosaic and Ezekiel's descriptions of the land's boundaries highlights its significance as a geographical marker and its role in defining the extent of the Promised Land. The inclusion of Zedad in these passages emphasizes the importance of the land's boundaries and the precision with which they were defined in the biblical record.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zela was a city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Jos.18:28). It is mentioned as part of a group of fourteen cities north of Jerusalem, though its exact location is uncertain. Some suggest it may be identified with Khirbet Salah between Jerusalem and Gibeon. Notably, Zela contained the ancestral tomb of Kish, the father of King Saul. After Saul and his sons were killed by the Philistines, David had their bones buried in this tomb at Zela (2Sa.21:14). The name Zela in Hebrew may mean &quot;rib&quot; or &quot;side&quot; as of a hill. Zela is possibly the same as Zilu mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zelzah was a place near Rachel's tomb in Benjamin that Samuel referenced when giving directions to Saul (1Sa.10:2).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zelzah is mentioned only once in the Bible as a place that the prophet Samuel used as a landmark when giving directions to Saul after anointing him as king (1Sa.10:2). Samuel told Saul that he would meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. The exact location of Zelzah is unknown, but the reference to Rachel's tomb places it somewhere north of Jerusalem, likely between Ramah and Gibeah. </ext_description>

		<ext_description>Zemaraim refers to two distinct places in the Bible. One is a town in the territory of Benjamin, listed among the cities allotted to that tribe during the division of the Promised Land under Joshua (Jos.18:22). Its exact location is unknown. The other is Mount Zemaraim, a hill located in the hill country of Ephraim (2Ch.13:4). It was here that King Abijah of Judah stood to address the army of Jeroboam I of Israel before a battle. In his speech, Abijah denounced Jeroboam's rebellion against the house of David and called on Israel to not fight against the Lord. Abijah and Judah prevailed in the battle that followed.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zephath, later called Hormah, was a Canaanite city that Israel failed to capture but was later defeated by Judah and Simeon (Num.14:45; 21:3; Jdg.1:17).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zephath, later renamed Hormah, was a Canaanite city located in the Negev desert region. During the Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness, they attempted to enter Canaan from the south, but the king of Arad fought against them and took some prisoners. Israel vowed to totally destroy the Canaanite cities if God would give them victory. God granted their request, and the Israelites &quot;utterly destroyed&quot; the Canaanites and named the place Hormah, meaning &quot;destruction&quot; (Num.21:1-3). ¶However, Israel later refused to enter Canaan from Kadesh Barnea out of unbelief. When they then presumptuously tried to go up, the Amalekites and Canaanites defeated them as far as Hormah (Num.14:45; Dt.1:44). Much later, after Joshua's conquests, Judah and Simeon fought against Zephath, defeated it, and renamed it Hormah (Jdg.1:17). The city is subsequently listed among the towns in the Negev allotted to Judah and Simeon (Jos.15:30; 19:4; 1Ch.4:30). David later sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to his friends in Hormah (1Sa.30:30). The exact location is uncertain but it was likely somewhere south of the Dead Sea.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>The Zered Brook (also called the Valley of Zered or the Brook of Zered) was a significant geographical marker in Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. After wandering in the wilderness for 38 years, the Lord told the Israelites to cross the Zered Brook, signifying the end of the wilderness wanderings for that generation (Dt.2:13-14). The crossing of the Zered marked the beginning of the conquest of the lands east of the Jordan. The Zered Brook flowed into the southeastern end of the Dead Sea, forming the boundary between Edom to the south and Moab to the north. It is probably to be identified with the modern Wadi al-Hasa.</ext_description>

Jeroboam was an Ephraimite from Zeredah who was a valiant warrior and an industrious worker. King Solomon noticed Jeroboam's abilities and made him the overseer of the forced labor of the house of Joseph. However, the prophet Ahijah prophesied that God would tear the kingdom from Solomon's son and give ten tribes to Jeroboam. When Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, he fled to Egypt until Solomon's death. Zeredah's exact location is unknown but was likely in the hill country of Ephraim.</ext_description>

		<ext_description>Ziklag was a city located in the Negev region of Judah, initially allotted to the tribe of Judah (Jos.15:31) and later to Simeon (Jos.19:5; 1Ch.4:30). The Philistine king Achish of Gath gave the city to David when he fled from King Saul (1Sa.27:6). David and his men lived there for over a year, making raids on the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites (1Sa.27:8-9). While David and his men were away, the Amalekites attacked and burned Ziklag, taking captive the women and children (1Sa.30:1-2). David pursued them, defeated them, and recovered all that was taken (1Sa.30:18-20). David sent some of the spoils from this victory to his friends in Judah (1Sa.30:26). After Saul's death, David departed from Ziklag to go to Hebron (2Sa.1:1). During David's reign, some Benjamites and Manassites defected to him at Ziklag (1Ch.12:1,20). In the time of Nehemiah, Ziklag was reinhabited by the people of Judah (Neh.11:28). Its exact location is uncertain.</ext_description>

		<short_description>The Wilderness of Zin was a desert region south of Judah where the Israelites encamped during their wilderness wanderings (Num.13:21; 20:1; 33:36).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zin refers to a desert and wilderness region located south of Judah, east of the Arabah, and west of Edom. During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, they encamped in the Wilderness of Zin on the border of Edom (Num.20:1; 33:36). It was from here that Moses sent spies to explore the land of Canaan (Num.13:21). Later, Moses and Aaron rebelled against God's command to speak to the rock to bring forth water, instead striking it twice (Num.27:14). As a result, they were not allowed to enter the Promised Land. The Wilderness of Zin formed part of the southern border of the land allotted to Judah (Jos.15:1,3). It marked the extreme southern limit of the Promised Land (Num.34:3-4). The Wilderness of Zin is also associated with Kadesh (Num.33:36), a significant site during Israel's wilderness journey. The name &quot;Zin&quot; may be related to a Hebrew term meaning &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;low,&quot; possibly referring to its lower elevation compared to the surrounding regions.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Ziph was a town in the hill country of Judah where David hid from Saul in the nearby wilderness (Jos.15:55; 1Sa.23:14-15).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Ziph was a town in the hill country of Judah, southeast of Hebron (Jos.15:55). The wilderness near Ziph was where David hid from King Saul (1Sa.23:14-15). On two occasions, the Ziphites informed Saul of David's whereabouts (1Sa.23:19; 26:1). In the wilderness of Ziph, David spared Saul's life when he had the opportunity to kill him (1Sa.26:2-12). The town of Ziph is probably to be identified with Tell Zif, about 4 miles southeast of Hebron. Ruins have been found there, along with a spring. Psalm 54 is associated with David's time hiding from Saul in the region of Ziph.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zoan was an ancient Egyptian city where God performed miracles through Moses; it is probably to be identified with Tanis (Num.13:22; Ps.78:12,43).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zoan was an ancient city of Egypt, mentioned in several contexts in the Bible. It was one of the cities built by the Israelites during their enslavement in Egypt (Num.13:22). The fields of Zoan were the site of God's miracles and mighty acts during the time of Moses (Ps.78:12,43). The princes of Zoan are described as fools, unable to give wise counsel to Pharaoh (Isa.19:11,13). Zoan is also mentioned as a place where the rebellious Israelites sent messengers, seeking help from Egypt rather than trusting in God (Isa.30:4). Ezekiel prophesied that Zoan would be in terror and face God's judgment (Ezk.30:14). Zoan is most likely to be identified with Tanis, an important city in the Nile Delta region of ancient Egypt. It served as a capital during the 21st and 22nd dynasties.</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zoar, also known as Bela, was a small city near Sodom where Lot fled when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen.13:10; 19:22-23).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zoar, also known as Bela, was one of the five cities of the plain, along with Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen.14:2,8). It was originally called Bela but was renamed Zoar, which means &quot;small,&quot; when Lot pleaded for it to be spared from destruction due to its small size (Gen.19:20-22). Lot and his daughters fled to Zoar when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen.19:23). Later, Lot left Zoar and settled in the mountains with his daughters (Gen.19:30). Zoar is mentioned as a reference point for the description of the Promised Land (Deut.34:3). The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah used Zoar to illustrate the extent of God's judgment on Moab (Isa.15:5; Jer.48:34). Zoar is most likely located at the southern end of the Dead Sea, although its exact location is uncertain. It is possibly to be identified with Khirbet el-Keryeh or Tell Iktanu. The name Zair is used in reference to a different location, where Joram fought against Edom (2Ki.8:21).</ext_description>

		<short_description>Zobah was an Aramean kingdom northeast of Israel, conquered by David and later a source of opposition to Solomon (1Sa.14:47; 2Sa.8:3; 1Ki.11:23).</short_description>
		<ext_description>Zobah, also referred to as Zobah-Hamath or Hamath-zobah, was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of Israel, in the region of modern-day Syria. During the reigns of Saul and David, the kings of Zobah were enemies of Israel (1Sa.14:47; 2Sa.8:3). David defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and his Aramean allies (2Sa.8:5,12; 10:6,8; 1Ch.18:5,9; 19:6). One of David's mighty men, Igal, was from Zobah (2Sa.23:36). During Solomon's reign, Rezon of Zobah established himself as king in Damascus and became an adversary to Israel (1Ki.11:23). Solomon later conquered Hamath-zobah (2Ch.8:3). The exact extent and location of Zobah are uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region between Hamath and Damascus, possibly centered around the modern-day city of Homs in Syria.</ext_description>

It was originally allotted to the tribe of Judah (Jos.15:33) but later became part of the territory of Dan (Jos.19:41). Zorah was the hometown of Samson, the judge of Israel (Jdg.13:2). The Spirit of the Lord began to stir Samson in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol (Jdg.13:25). Men from Zorah and Eshtaol were involved in the Danite migration (Jdg.18:2,8,11). Samson was buried between Zorah and Eshtaol (Jdg.16:31). During the reign of Rehoboam, Zorah was fortified as a defensive city (2Ch.11:10). In the time of Nehemiah, the people of Zorah helped rebuild Jerusalem (Neh.11:29). Zorah is identified with the modern-day village of Sar'a, about 15 miles west of Jerusalem.</ext_description>

When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost donkeys, they passed through the land of Zuph. As they were about to return home, Saul's servant suggested that they consult the prophet Samuel, who was in a nearby city, for guidance (1Sa.9:6). This led to Saul's anointing as the first king of Israel by Samuel. The exact location and extent of the land of Zuph are not specified, but it was likely in the general vicinity of Samuel's hometown, Ramah, in the hill country of Ephraim.</ext_description>
