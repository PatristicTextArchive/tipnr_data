Could I not wash in them and be clean?\" The Abana was apparently a significant and highly regarded river near Damascus. Naaman considered it superior to the Jordan River of Israel. After his servants reasoned with him, Naaman relented and washed in the Jordan as instructed, and his leprosy was cured. The Abana River is generally identified with the modern Barada River, the primary river that flows through Damascus.",

It was established in 27 BC and lasted until the reforms of Diocletian in the late 3rd century AD. In the New Testament, Achaia is mentioned primarily in connection with Paul's ministry and the churches he established or visited in the region. ¶Paul spent considerable time in Corinth, the capital of Achaia, on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1-18). It was there that he was brought before the judgment seat of Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia (Acts 18:12). Later, Apollos visited Achaia and ministered in Corinth (Acts 18:27-19:1). ¶Paul wrote several epistles to churches in Achaia, including 1 and 2 Corinthians, addressed to the church in Corinth, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians to the church in Thessalonica, the capital of neighboring Macedonia. In his epistles, Paul commended the generosity of the churches of Achaia in giving to the collection for the believers in Jerusalem (Romans 15:26, 2 Corinthians 9:2) and noted their role in spreading the gospel (1 Thessalonians 1:7-8). ¶The churches in Achaia faced significant challenges, including divisions, immorality, and false teachings, as addressed in Paul's epistles to them. Nevertheless, Achaia remained an important center of early Christianity, producing influential leaders such as Stephanas (1 Corinthians 16:15) and Phoebe (Romans 16:1).",

The Valley of Achor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:7). ¶In later prophetic writings, the Valley of Achor is used symbolically. Isaiah 65:10 portrays it as a place of rest and abundance for God's people in the future messianic age. Hosea 2:15 describes it as a place of hope and restoration, where God will turn Israel's sorrow into joy, comparing it to a \"door of hope.\" These passages suggest that the Valley of Achor, once a place of judgment and trouble, will become a symbol of God's blessing and redemption for His people.",

During the voyage, Paul's ship encountered a severe storm, and they were driven by the wind for many days. On the fourteenth night of the storm, the sailors sensed they were approaching land and took soundings, fearing they might run aground on the rocks. ¶In the context of Acts 27, the term \"Adriatic Sea\" likely refers to a broader area that includes not only the modern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Croatia but also the central Mediterranean Sea south of Greece and west of Crete. This understanding is based on the usage of the term in ancient sources and the probable route of Paul's ship. ¶The storm that Paul's ship encountered was likely a Euraquilo, a strong northeasterly wind that blows in the Mediterranean during the winter months. The ship was eventually wrecked on the island of Malta (Acts 28:1), where Paul and the other survivors were welcomed by the islanders and spent three months before continuing their journey to Rome. The mention of the Adriatic Sea in Acts 27 highlights the dangers and challenges of maritime travel in the ancient world and provides a vivid backdrop for Paul's perilous journey to stand trial before Caesar.",

However, the tribe of Asher failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of Ahlab, and as a result, the Canaanites continued to live among them (Judges 1:31). ¶This failure to completely conquer and possess the allotted territory was a common problem for several Israelite tribes during the period of the judges. The continued presence of Canaanites in cities like Ahlab would have exposed the Israelites to the influence of pagan religions and practices, which ultimately led to spiritual decline and disobedience to God. The exact location of Ahlab is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the site of Khirbet el-Mahalib, about 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Tyre.",

However, they considered it unlawful to put the money into the temple treasury, as it was \"blood money.\" Instead, they used the money to purchase a potter's field as a burial place for foreigners (Matthew 27:7). ¶In Acts, the field is called Akeldama, and it is stated that Judas bought the field with the reward of his wickedness and fell headlong there, bursting open in the middle, and his intestines gushed out (Acts 1:18). The field was then known as the Field of Blood because of its association with Judas' death and the blood money used to purchase it. ¶The location of Akeldama is traditionally identified as a site south of Jerusalem, near the junction of the Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. The area has been used as a burial ground for centuries, with numerous tombs and burial caves dating from ancient times to the present day. ¶The purchase of Akeldama with the money from Judas' betrayal is seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, as stated in Matthew 27:9-10, which quotes from Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. The field serves as a reminder of the tragic consequences of Judas' betrayal and the ultimate redemption brought about by Jesus' sacrifice.",

They inhabited the desert regions of the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev. The Amalekites were the first nation to attack Israel after the Exodus, at Rephidim (Exodus 17:8-16). Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur, interceded for Israel while Joshua led the army in battle. As a result, God declared that He would be at war with Amalek from generation to generation (Exodus 17:16). ¶The Amalekites, along with other enemies, continued to harass Israel during the period of the judges (Judges 3:13; 6:3,33; 7:12; 10:12). Saul, Israel's first king, was commanded to completely destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:2-3). However, he disobeyed by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the livestock (1 Samuel 15:7-9). This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king (1 Samuel 15:23; 28:18). ¶During David's reign, the Amalekites were among the enemies he defeated (1 Samuel 30:1-20; 2 Samuel 8:12; 1 Chronicles 18:11). The last mention of the Amalekites is in 1 Chronicles 4:43, which records that some of the Simeonites destroyed the remnant of the Amalekites during the time of Hezekiah. ¶The Amalekites are also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts as symbols of Israel's enemies (Numbers 24:20; Psalm 83:7). Their persistent opposition to Israel and their role in the narratives of Saul and David make them significant adversaries in the biblical history of Israel.",

The Ammonites were descendants of Ben-ammi, the son of Lot by his younger daughter (Genesis 19:38). They inhabited the area north of Moab and east of the tribe of Reuben. ¶Throughout history, the Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel. During the time of the judges, the Ammonites oppressed Israel (Judges 10:6-9) until Jephthah defeated them (Judges 11). Saul fought against the Ammonites and rescued Jabesh-gilead from their siege (1 Samuel 11:1-11). David, during his reign, also engaged in battles with the Ammonites (2 Samuel 10; 12:26-31). ¶The Ammonite capital city was Rabbah (also known as Rabbath-Ammon), which was besieged and captured by Joab, David's commander (2 Samuel 12:26-29). The city later became part of the Ammonite territory again. The Ammonites were known for their worship of the god Milcom (1 Kings 11:5,33; 2 Kings 23:13). ¶The prophets often spoke against Ammon for their hostility towards Israel and predicted their downfall (Jeremiah 49:1-6; Ezekiel 21:28-32; 25:1-7; Amos 1",

Amphipolis was originally an Athenian colony but later came under Macedonian and then Roman control. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities in Amphipolis, the mention of the city in the context of his journey highlights the strategic importance of the Via Egnatia for the spread of the gospel in the region. The inclusion of Amphipolis in the itinerary demonstrates Paul's intentional efforts to reach major cities and transportation hubs with the message of Christ.",

Jeremiah faced opposition from the people of his hometown, who plotted against his life because of his prophecies (Jeremiah 11:21-23). The prophet also received a divine command to purchase a field in Anathoth, which served as a sign of the future restoration of Judah (Jeremiah 32:7-9). ¶Several prominent figures in the Bible were associated with Anathoth, including Abiathar, a priest during the reign of King Solomon, who was exiled to Anathoth after supporting Adonijah's claim to the throne (1 Kings 2:26). Two of David's mighty men, Abiezer and Jehu, were also from Anathoth (2 Samuel 23:27; 1 Chronicles 11:28; 12:3; 27:12). ¶Anathoth was among the towns resettled by the Benjamites after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:23; Nehemiah 7:27; 11:32).

The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch, who encouraged the believers and brought Saul (Paul) there to teach (Acts 11:22-26). ¶It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians (Acts 11:26). The city became a hub for missionary activity, with Paul and Barnabas being sent out from Antioch on their first missionary journey (Acts 13:1-3; 14:26). The church in Antioch also played a crucial role in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law (Acts 15:1-35). ¶Antioch was the home church of several notable figures, including the prophet Agabus (Acts 11:27-28) and the evangelist Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch (Acts 6:5). The apostle Peter visited Antioch, where Paul confronted him about his inconsistent behavior regarding Gentile believers (Galatians 2:11-14). ¶The church in Antioch became a model of a multicultural, mission-oriented congregation, demonstrating the power of the gospel to transcend cultural barriers and unite believers in Christ.

It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas visited Antioch in Pisidia, where Paul preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 13:14-41). ¶Paul's message in the synagogue focused on Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the offer of forgiveness of sins through faith in Him. While some of the Jews and proselytes believed, others rejected the message and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, forcing them to leave the city (Acts 13:42-52). ¶Later, on their return journey, Paul and Barnabas revisited Antioch in Pisidia, strengthening the disciples and appointing elders in the church (Acts 14:21-23). However, the city continued to be a place of opposition, as Jews from Antioch and Iconium followed Paul and Barnabas to Lystra, where they stoned Paul and left him for dead (Acts 14:19-20). ¶In his second letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions and sufferings he endured in Antioch, along with Iconium and Lystra, highlighting the challenges he faced while preaching the gospel in these cities (2 Timothy 3:11). ¶The events in Antioch in Pisidia demonstrate the mixed response to the gospel message, with some embracing it and others violently opposing it.

It is mentioned in Acts 23:31 in connection with the apostle Paul's transfer from Jerusalem to Caesarea. After a plot against Paul's life was uncovered, the Roman commander ordered soldiers to escort Paul to Antipatris by night, ensuring his safety. ¶The city of Antipatris was built by Herod the Great and named after his father, Antipater. It was situated in a strategic location along the major road connecting Jerusalem to Caesarea, the Roman capital of Judea. The soldiers brought Paul to Antipatris, where they likely rested before continuing the journey to Caesarea the following day. ¶The mention of Antipatris in the account of Paul's transfer highlights the Roman authorities' concern for his safety and their efforts to protect him from the Jewish conspirators who sought to kill him. The city served as a stopover point on the journey, allowing the soldiers to cover a significant distance from Jerusalem and ensuring Paul's secure arrival in Caesarea. ¶Apart from this single reference in the context of Paul's transfer, no other information about Antipatris is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the narrative demonstrates the historical and geographical accuracy of the biblical account and the efficiency of the Roman military in transporting prisoners.",

Despite the vast Aramean army, the Israelites, guided by a prophet, achieved a decisive victory. The Arameans fled to Aphek, where a wall collapsed and killed many of them (1 Kings 20:26-30). ¶Later, during the reign of Jehoash, Aphek is mentioned again in the context of the Aramean oppression of Israel. The prophet Elisha, on his deathbed, instructed King Jehoash to shoot an arrow from the window, symbolizing the Lord's arrow of victory over the Arameans at Aphek (2 Kings 13:17). ¶The precise location of this Aphek is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Fiq, a site in the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley, near the modern-day town of Kibbutz Afik.

The Arabah is described as part of the route they took and as a region they passed through. ¶The Arabah is also mentioned in the book of Joshua as a reference point for the boundaries of the tribal allotments (Joshua 11:16; 12:1, 3, 8; 18:18). It served as a natural border between the territories of the tribes settling in Canaan. ¶In the historical books, the Arabah is associated with events such as David's flight from Absalom (2 Samuel 2:29; 4:7) and the escape of King Zedekiah from Jerusalem during the Babylonian invasion (2 Kings 25:4; Jeremiah 39:4; 52:7). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel mention the Arabah in their prophecies. Isaiah speaks of the Arabah as a place of desolation (Isaiah 33:9), while Ezekiel envisions a future restoration where the waters flowing from the temple will bring life to the Arabah (Ezekiel 47:8). ¶The Arabah's arid climate and sparse vegetation make it a challenging environment.

In the Bible, Arabia and its inhabitants, the Arabs or Arbites, are mentioned in various contexts, ranging from commercial interactions to prophetic messages. ¶The Queen of Sheba, who visited King Solomon, is said to have brought gifts from Arabia, including gold, spices, and precious stones (1 Kings 10:15; 2 Chronicles 9:14). The Arabians also paid tribute to King Jehoshaphat of Judah (2 Chronicles 17:11) and were among the enemies who attacked Judah during the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah (2 Chronicles 21:16; 22:1). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel mention Arabia and its inhabitants in their prophecies. Isaiah delivers a message concerning Arabia, foretelling the decline of its glory (Isaiah 21:13-17). Jeremiah includes the kings of Arabia among those who will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:24). Ezekiel lists Arabia as one of the nations that traded with Tyre (Ezekiel 27:21) and includes the Arabians among the allies of Egypt who will fall (Ezekiel 30:5). ¶In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul mentions his visit to Arabia after his conversion (Galatians 1:17) and uses Mount Sinai in Arabia as an allegory for the earthly Jerusalem (Galatians 4:25). On the day of Pentecost, Arabs were among the people who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11). ¶The Arabians were known for their nomadic lifestyle, traveling through the desert with their herds and engaging in trade. They were skilled in archery and horsemanship, making them formidable opponents in warfare. ¶Throughout the Bible, Arabia and its people are portrayed as having both positive and negative interactions with Israel and the surrounding nations, reflecting the complex dynamics of the ancient Near East.",

It is most famously known as the place where Noah's ark came to rest after the great flood, as recorded in Genesis 8:4. The specific mountain is often identified as Mount Ararat, which consists of two peaks: Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat. ¶In the Bible, Ararat is also mentioned in the context of historical events. In 2 Kings 19:37 and Isaiah 37:38, it is recorded that Adrammelech and Sharezer, the sons of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, fled to the land of Ararat after assassinating their father. This suggests that Ararat was a recognized geographical and political entity during the time of the Assyrian Empire. ¶Furthermore, in Jeremiah 51:27, Ararat is mentioned alongside Minni and Ashkenaz as kingdoms summoned to rise up against Babylon. This prophetic passage foretells the fall of Babylon and the role that the kingdoms of Ararat and its allies would play in this event. ¶The biblical references to Ararat highlight its significance as a geographical landmark and its association with important events in biblical history, most notably the landing of Noah's ark and the preservation of life after the flood. The mention of Ararat in the context of political alliances and conflicts also demonstrates its relevance in the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East.",

It served as a meeting place for the Athenian council, which was responsible for judicial and legislative matters in the city. The Areopagus is most notably mentioned in Acts 17 in connection with the Apostle Paul's visit to Athens during his second missionary journey. ¶According to Acts 17:19, some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered Paul and brought him to the Areopagus to inquire about his teachings. They were intrigued by Paul's message about Jesus and the resurrection, which they considered to be foreign concepts. ¶Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, Paul delivered a powerful speech, addressing the religious and philosophical beliefs of the Athenians (Acts 17:22-31). He observed that the city was full of idols and even found an altar dedicated to an \"unknown god.\" Paul used this as a starting point to proclaim the one true God, the Creator of all things, who is not confined to man-made temples or idols. ¶Paul's message at the Areopagus emphasized the sovereignty of God, the need for repentance, and the reality of the resurrection and coming judgment through Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus council, and a woman named Damaris (Acts 17:34). ¶The account of Paul's preaching at the Areopagus demonstrates his ability to engage with the intellectual and philosophical currents of his time, adapting his message to the audience while remaining faithful to the core truths of the gospel. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities the early church faced in proclaiming the message of Christ in a diverse and pluralistic society.",

It is mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses and Joshua. ¶In Deuteronomy 3:4, Argob is described as a region containing sixty fortified cities, all of which were captured by the Israelites during their conquest of Og, the king of Bashan. These cities were noted for their high walls, gates, and bars, indicating their strong defensive capabilities (Deuteronomy 3:5). ¶The region of Argob was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 3:13). Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of Argob and named it Havvoth-jair, which means \"the towns of Jair\" (Deuteronomy 3:14). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Argob was included in the territory governed by one of his twelve officers, who was responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household (1 Kings 4:13). ¶The biblical references to Argob highlight its significance as a fortified and strategically important region in the Transjordan area. The conquest of Argob by the Israelites demonstrates their military success under divine guidance and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. The region's inclusion in the allotment of the tribes and its mention during Solomon's reign underscore its ongoing importance in the history of Israel.",

It is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament, primarily in the context of Israel's journey to the Promised Land and the subsequent division of the territory. ¶During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, the Arnon served as a boundary between the Moabites and the Amorites (Numbers 21:13). The Amorites, led by King Sihon, had previously conquered the land north of the Arnon from the Moabites (Numbers 21:26). When the Israelites requested passage through Sihon's territory, he refused and engaged them in battle. Israel defeated Sihon and took possession of the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok (Numbers 21:24). ¶The Arnon later served as the southern border of the territory assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12, 16; Joshua 13:9, 16). It also marked the southern limit of the region controlled by King Sihon (Deuteronomy 2:36; Joshua 12:2) and, in later years, the extent of Jephthah's victories over the Ammonites (Judges 11:18, 22). ¶During the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory east of the Jordan, including the area from the Arnon, was lost to Hazael, king of Aram (2 Kings 10:33). The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah also mention the Arnon in their prophecies concerning Moab (Isaiah 16:2; Jeremiah 48:20). ¶The Arnon's significance in the Bible lies in its role as a geographical boundary, marking the limits of territorial control for various nations and tribes throughout Israel's history. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a strategic landmark in the region.",

Jehoiakim, who reigned in the early 6th century BC, was a vassal of Egypt and later Babylon.

        "ext_description": "Arvad, also known as Arwad or Arados, was an island city located off the coast of Syria, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Tripolis. It is mentioned in Ezekiel 27 as one of the cities that provided skilled mariners and soldiers for the maritime trade and defense of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city. ¶In Ezekiel's lamentation over Tyre, he describes the city's vast trading network and the various nations that contributed to its wealth and power. Arvad is noted for its role in supplying sailors to navigate Tyre's ships (Ezekiel 27:8) and soldiers to guard its walls (Ezekiel 27:11). This indicates that Arvad had a reputation for producing experienced seafarers and well-trained warriors. ¶Arvad was part of the Phoenician civilization and had a long history of maritime trade and cultural exchange with other Mediterranean nations. The city was situated on a small, rocky island with limited natural resources, which likely contributed to its focus on seafaring and commerce. ¶The biblical mention of Arvad in the context of Tyre's trade and military alliances highlights the interconnected nature of the Phoenician city-states and their shared expertise in navigation and maritime affairs. It also underscores the significance of Arvad as a valuable partner in Tyre's economic and defensive network. ¶Apart from its appearance in Ezekiel's prophecy, Arvad is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. However, its inclusion in this passage provides insight into the geopolitical and commercial landscape of the ancient Near East during the time of Ezekiel's ministry.",

However, in Joshua 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32, Ashan is included in the list of cities given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance. ¶Later, in 1 Chronicles 6:59, Ashan is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, along with its pasturelands. This suggests that Ashan was designated as a Levitical city, where the priests and Levites resided and served in their sacred duties. ¶The exact location of Ashan is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be situated in the northwestern part of the Judean Shephelah, possibly near the city of Libnah. Some scholars propose identifying Ashan with the modern site of Khirbet Hasan, approximately 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Lachish. ¶The biblical references to Ashan highlight its inclusion in the territorial distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. Its assignment to both Judah and Simeon and its subsequent designation as a Levitical city underscore the complex process of land allocation and the provision for the Levites within the inherited territories.",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of conflict with Israel and as a target of prophetic judgment. ¶In Judges 1:18, Ashkelon is listed among the cities captured by the tribe of Judah during the conquest of Canaan. However, the city later reverted to Philistine control. Judges 14:19 records that Samson, empowered by the Spirit of the Lord, went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their garments to pay a debt. ¶Ashkelon is mentioned as one of the Philistine cities that received a golden tumor as a guilt offering when the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel (1 Samuel 6:17). In 2 Samuel 1:20, David laments the death of Saul and Jonathan, urging that the news not be proclaimed in Ashkelon, lest the Philistines rejoice. ¶Several prophets, including Jeremiah, Amos, and Zephaniah, pronounce judgments against Ashkelon. Jeremiah includes Ashkelon among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:20) and describes the city as cut off and bereaved (Jeremiah 47:5, 7). Amos prophesies that God will send fire upon Ashkelon (Amos 1:8), while Zephaniah declares that Ashkelon will become a desolation (Zephaniah 2:4) but also foresees a future restoration (Zephaniah 2:7). Zechariah portrays Ashkelon as fearful and mourning in the face of God's judgment (Zechariah 9:5). ¶Throughout its biblical history, Ashkelon remains a significant Philistine stronghold and a symbol of opposition to Israel. The city's inclusion in prophetic oracles underscores its importance and the divine judgment it would face for its hostility toward God's people.",

Some scholars propose that Ashkenaz may have been located in the vicinity of the Caspian Sea or in the region of Armenia. ¶The mention of Ashkenaz in Jeremiah's prophecy suggests that it was a significant power or ally that could contribute to the downfall of Babylon. By including Ashkenaz in the list of nations arrayed against Babylon, the prophet emphasizes the broad coalition that would bring about the city's destruction. ¶Apart from this single reference in Jeremiah, Ashkenaz is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in connection with Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled over the city. ¶In Deuteronomy 1:4, Ashtaroth is named as one of the cities defeated by the Israelites, along with Edrei, after they had conquered Sihon, king of the Amorites. Joshua 9:10 and 12:4 also mention Ashtaroth as part of the territory ruled by Og, who was one of the last remnants of the Rephaim, a race of giants. ¶After the conquest of Bashan, Ashtaroth was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Joshua 13:31). However, the city was later designated as a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Gershon (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This indicates that Ashtaroth was one of the cities set apart for the Levites to dwell in and perform their sacred duties. ¶In 1 Chronicles 11:44, Ashtaroth is mentioned as the hometown of Uzzia, one of David's mighty men, suggesting that the city had Israelite inhabitants during the time of David's reign. ¶The name Ashtaroth is also associated with the Canaanite goddess Astarte, and it is possible that the city was a center of her worship before the Israelite conquest. The biblical writers often used the name Ashtaroth to refer to the goddess herself or to the plural form of Astarte, representing multiple goddesses or idols. ¶The city of Ashtaroth was strategically located in the fertile region of Bashan, known for its rich pastures and livestock. Its mention in the Bible highlights the Israelites' victories over the powerful kings of the region and the allotment of the conquered territories to the tribes of Israel, including the Levites.",

It should not be confused with the modern continent of Asia. ¶In Acts, Asia is mentioned several times in the context of Paul's missionary journeys. Jews from Asia were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9), and some belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen, who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). Paul traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia (Acts 16:6). Later, Paul spent two years in Ephesus, and all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord (Acts 19:10). Demetrius, a silversmith who made shrines of Artemis, stirred up a crowd against Paul, fearing that Paul's preaching would undermine the worship of Artemis, whom all Asia revered (Acts 19:26-27). ¶In his farewell address to the Ephesian elders, Paul mentions that he had faced plots by the Jews from Asia (Acts 20:18-19). When Paul visited the temple in Jerusalem, Jews from Asia stirred up the crowd against him (Acts 21:27). During Paul's voyage to Rome, the ship stopped at Myra in Lycia, where an Alexandrian ship was found sailing for Italy (Acts 27:2). ¶The churches in Asia are mentioned in the opening of 1 Peter (1 Peter 1:1) and Revelation (Revelation 1:4, 11). Paul also sends greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and to the church in their house, the first fruits of Asia (1 Corinthians 16:19; Romans 16:5). In 2 Timothy, Paul writes that all those in Asia had turned away from him (2 Timothy 1:15). ¶These references to Asia in the New Testament provide insight into the early spread of Christianity and the challenges faced by the apostles in this region of the Roman Empire.",

The plan was for Paul to meet them in Assos and join them on the ship. After meeting up in Assos, they sailed together to Mitylene. ¶The reason for Paul's decision to travel by land to Assos is not explicitly stated in the text. Some scholars suggest that Paul may have wanted to visit friends or churches along the way, or that he needed time alone for prayer and reflection. ¶Assos was situated on the Aegean coast, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Troas. It was known for its strong walls, which were built from the local volcanic rock. The city also had a significant harbor and was an important trade center in the region. ¶Apart from this brief mention in Acts, Assos does not play a significant role in the New Testament narrative.

The Assyrians are mentioned extensively throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of their military conquests and their interactions with the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. ¶The name \"Asshur\" first appears in Genesis 10:11, where it is associated with Nimrod, who is said to have built several cities, including Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. In Genesis 25:18, the descendants of Ishmael are described as living in the region from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as one goes toward Assyria. ¶Assyria began to emerge as a significant power in the 9th century BC, and its kings are mentioned in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III is recorded as receiving tribute from Jehu, king of Israel (2 Kings 15:19-20). Later, Tiglath-Pileser III, also known as Pul, conquered parts of Israel and deported some of its inhabitants (2 Kings 15:29; 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26). ¶The Assyrian Empire reached its zenith during the reign of Sennacherib, who is known for his military campaigns against Judah and his siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18-19; 2 Chronicles 32; Isaiah 36-37). The prophet Isaiah played a significant role in encouraging Hezekiah to trust in God and resist the Assyrian threat. ¶Other Assyrian kings, such as Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, are also mentioned in the Bible (Ezra 4:2; 2 Chronicles 33:11). The fall of the Assyrian Empire is alluded to in the prophetic books, particularly in Nahum, which foretells the destruction of Nineveh (Nahum 3:18-19).",

In Joshua 16:5, Ataroth-addar is mentioned as part of the description of Ephraim's territory, specifically its southern border. The town is listed along with Beth-horon as marking the extent of Ephraim's inheritance. ¶In Joshua 18:13, Ataroth-addar appears again in the delineation of Benjamin's territory. The verse states that the border extended from there to Ataroth-addar, near the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. This description places Ataroth-addar in the vicinity of Beth-horon, a strategically important town in the western foothills of the central hill country. ¶The name Ataroth-addar likely combines two elements: \"Ataroth,\" meaning \"crowns\" or \"wreaths,\" and \"Addar,\" which may be a personal name or a descriptive term. The exact location of Ataroth-addar is not known with certainty, but its repeated mention in the boundary descriptions underscores its significance as a border town between Ephraim and Benjamin. ¶Apart from its role in demarcating tribal territories, no other information about Ataroth-addar is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary lists of Joshua highlights the importance of establishing clear territorial divisions among the tribes of Israel as they settled in the Promised Land.",

The context of 1 Samuel 30 suggests that Athach was among the towns where David had previously found support and refuge during his time fleeing from King Saul. ¶David's act of sharing the spoils with Athach and other towns demonstrates his gratitude for their assistance and his desire to strengthen his relationships with the people of Judah. This gesture also foreshadows David's future role as king over all Israel, as he sought to build alliances and establish his authority in the region. ¶Apart from this single reference in 1 Samuel, no other information about Athach is provided in the Bible.

The attack by the Canaanite king of Arad was a significant challenge for the Israelites, as it threatened their progress and security in the region. ¶In response to this attack, the Israelites made a vow to the Lord, promising to utterly destroy the Canaanite cities if God would deliver them into their hands. God heard their plea and gave them victory over the Canaanites, leading to the destruction of their cities and the renaming of the place as Hormah, meaning \"destruction\" (Numbers 21:2-3). ¶The event at Atharim highlights the ongoing challenges and conflicts the Israelites faced during their wilderness journey, as well as their dependence on God's protection and intervention in the face of enemy attacks.

While waiting for them in Athens, Paul was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols. ¶Paul's time in Athens was marked by his interactions with the local philosophers and his famous sermon at the Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill (Acts 17:19-34). He engaged in discussions with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, who were intrigued by his teaching about Jesus and the resurrection. Some of them brought Paul to the Areopagus, where he delivered a discourse, starting with a reference to an altar dedicated to an unknown god. ¶In his sermon, Paul proclaimed the one true God, the Creator of all things, and called for repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris. ¶After his time in Athens, Paul traveled to Corinth (Acts 18:1), where he continued his ministry. Later, in his letters to the Thessalonians, Paul mentioned sending Timothy to them from Athens to strengthen and encourage them in their faith (1 Thessalonians 3:1-2).",

During the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the town was allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Numbers 32:38; Joshua 13:17). The Reubenites rebuilt the city and renamed it, possibly to remove its association with the Canaanite deity Baal (Numbers 32:38). However, the town later reverted to Moabite control, as evidenced by its mention in the prophecies against Moab (Jeremiah 48:23; Ezekiel 25:9). The town was located in the territory of the Moabites, east of the Dead Sea (Numbers 32:3). Baal-meon was likely situated near the border between Moab and Reuben's territory, as it was mentioned in the context of the Reubenite settlements (1 Chronicles 5:8).",

        "ext_description": "Babylon, also known as Babel, was an ancient city located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) along the Euphrates River. It served as the capital of the Babylonian Empire, one of the most powerful empires in the ancient Near East. The city first appears in the Bible in Genesis 10:10 as part of Nimrod's kingdom and is identified as the location of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:9). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Babylon is mentioned as a major political and military power, often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The city became the dominant power in the region under King Nebuchadnezzar II, who conquered Judah, destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, and exiled many Jews to Babylon (2 Kings 24-25; 2 Chronicles 36). The Babylonian captivity lasted for 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:11; 29:10). ¶Several Old Testament prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, prophesied against Babylon, foretelling its eventual downfall (Isaiah 13-14; Jeremiah 50-51; Ezekiel 26-32). In these prophecies, Babylon is sometimes referred to by other names, such as Sheshak (Jeremiah 25:26; 51:41), Merathaim (Jeremiah 50:21), and Pekod (Jeremiah 50:21; Ezekiel 23:23), which are believed to be code names or references to specific regions within the Babylonian Empire. ¶After the Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC, the city gradually declined in importance. In the New Testament, Babylon is used symbolically to represent worldly power and opposition to God (Revelation 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21).",

Later, when David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei, a member of Saul's clan from Bahurim, cursed and threw stones at David and his men (2 Samuel 16:5). However, when David returned to Jerusalem after Absalom's defeat, Shimei met him at the Jordan River and apologized for his actions (2 Samuel 19:16; 1 Kings 2:8). ¶Bahurim is also mentioned as the hometown of Azmaveth, one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33). Additionally, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the sons of the priests Abiathar and Zadok, hid in a well at Bahurim to avoid being captured by Absalom's men while relaying information to David (2 Samuel 17:18).",

High places were elevated locations where pagan worship and sacrifices were often conducted. ¶The prophecy in Isaiah 15 foretells the judgment and devastation that would come upon Moab, a nation that had a history of conflict with Israel. The mention of the Moabites going to Bajith to weep and mourn highlights their distress and the futility of seeking help from their pagan gods in the face of God's judgment.",

In Joshua 13:17, Bamoth-baal is listed as one of the towns allotted to the tribe of Reuben in the territory east of the Jordan River. Numbers 21:28 also mentions Bamoth-baal in the context of the Amorite conquest of Moab before the Israelites arrived in the area.",

It was conquered by the Israelites during the time of Moses, along with the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan (Numbers 21:33; Deuteronomy 3:1-11). The land of Bashan was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Numbers 32:33; Joshua 13:29-31). ¶The region was known for its strong oak trees (Isaiah 2:13; Ezekiel 27:6) and its well-nourished cattle, often referred to as the \"bulls of Bashan\" (Deuteronomy 32:14; Psalm 22:12; Amos 4:1). It was also famous for its rich pastures (Jeremiah 50:19; Micah 7:14) and its fertile soil, which was well-suited for growing crops (Psalm 135:11; 136:20). ¶Bashan was one of the regions from which Solomon received supplies for his royal court (1 Kings 4:13). It was also the homeland of Golan, one of the cities of refuge designated by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8; 21:27). ¶Several Old Testament passages use Bashan as a symbol of God's power and judgment (Psalm 68:15, 22; Isaiah 33:9; Jeremiah 22:20; Ezekiel 39:18; Zechariah 11:2). The region was also mentioned in the context of God's blessings and provision for His people (Deuteronomy 33:22; Nehemiah 9:22).",

It was the location where the apostle Peter, accompanied by John, encountered a man who had been lame from birth. The man was carried daily to the gate to ask for alms from those entering the temple courts. ¶As Peter and John approached the gate, the man asked them for money. Instead, Peter commanded the man to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Instantly, the man's feet and ankles were made strong, and he began to walk, leap, and praise God. This miracle attracted the attention of the people, who were astonished to see the man walking and praising God. ¶The exact location and appearance of the Beautiful Gate are not described in detail in the Bible. It is believed to have been one of the main entrances to the temple complex, possibly leading from the Court of the Gentiles to the Court of Women. The gate's name suggests that it was likely an ornate and impressive structure. ¶The healing of the lame man at the Beautiful Gate was a significant event in the early church, demonstrating the power of the risen Christ and the authority of the apostles to perform miracles in His name. It also provided an opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel to the gathered crowd, resulting in many people coming to believe in Jesus (Acts 3:11-26).",

The Angel spoke to Hagar, encouraging her and instructing her to return to Sarah and submit to her. Hagar responded by calling the name of the Lord \"You are the God who sees,\" and she named the well Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 16:14). ¶Later, in Genesis 24:62, it is mentioned that Isaac, Abraham's son, was living in the Negev and had come from Beer-lahai-roi when Rebekah arrived to become his wife. After Abraham's death, Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 25:11). ¶The well of Beer-lahai-roi served as a significant location in the story of Hagar and her encounters with God.

During the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the people of Beeroth, along with those of Gibeon, Chephirah, and Kiriath-jearim, deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land (Joshua 9:17). ¶After the treaty was made, Beeroth was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Joshua 18:25). The city was located in the region north of Jerusalem, near Gibeon and Kiriath-jearim. ¶Beeroth is mentioned in connection with several events in the Bible. It was the hometown of two of David's mighty men, Naharai (2 Samuel 23:37; 1 Chronicles 11:39) and Rechab and Baanah, who murdered Ish-bosheth, Saul's son (2 Samuel 4:2-3, 5, 9). After the Babylonian exile, some of the people of Beeroth returned to Judah (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). ¶In Judges 9:21, Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, fled to Beer (possibly another name for Beeroth) for safety after confronting the people of Shechem about their support for his half-brother Abimelech, who had killed Jotham's brothers. ¶The city of Beeroth played a role in the early history of Israel, first as a Canaanite city that deceived the Israelites, then as part of the tribe of Benjamin's inheritance, and later as the hometown of some of David's mighty men and a place of refuge for Jotham.",

        "ext_description": "Beersheba, also known as Sheba or Shibah, was a significant city located in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. ¶The name \"Beersheba\" first appears in Genesis 21:31, where Abraham named the place after making a covenant with Abimelech, the king of Gerar. The name means \"well of seven\" or \"well of the oath,\" referring to the seven ewe lambs that Abraham gave to Abimelech as a witness to the covenant (Genesis 21:28-31). ¶Abraham lived in Beersheba for a time (Genesis 22:19), and it was from there that he set out to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice in the land of Moriah (Genesis 22:1-19). Isaac also lived in Beersheba, where he built an altar and called upon the name of the Lord (Genesis 26:23-25, 33). Jacob left Beersheba to go to Haran (Genesis 28:10) and later returned there to offer sacrifices to God before going to Egypt (Genesis 46:1, 5). ¶In the later history of Israel, Beersheba marked the southern extent of the nation, as seen in the phrase \"from Dan to Beersheba\" (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20; 2 Samuel 3:10; 17:11; 24:2, 15; 1 Kings 4:25). The city was allotted to the tribe of Simeon (Joshua 19:2) and became part of the kingdom of Judah (2 Samuel 24:7). ¶Beersheba was also a center of idolatry, as evidenced by the references to the \"way of Beersheba\" (Amos 8:14) and the \"sin of Samaria\" (Amos 5:5). King Josiah removed the idolatrous priests and destroyed the high places from Geba to Beersheba as part of his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:8). ¶In summary, Beersheba was a prominent city in the Negev, serving as a key location in the lives of the patriarchs and later as a boundary marker for the nation of Israel. Its history was marked by both faithfulness to God and idolatry.",

Sopater, a believer from Berea, later accompanied Paul on his return trip to Asia (Acts 20:4). The church in Berea stands as an example of a community that eagerly received the word of God and diligently studied the Scriptures.",

It was in Bethany that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, performing one of His most significant miracles (John 11:1-44). This event took place shortly before Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12:1, 9-11). ¶Bethany was also the place where Jesus was anointed by Mary, who poured expensive perfume on His feet and wiped them with her hair (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). This act of devotion took place in the house of Simon the leper, and it was criticized by Judas Iscariot as a waste of money. ¶In the Synoptic Gospels, Bethany is mentioned in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1, 17; Mark 11:1, 11-12; Luke 19:29). Jesus sent two of His disciples to Bethany to find a colt for Him to ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶After His resurrection, Jesus led His disciples out as far as Bethany before ascending into heaven (Luke 24:50-51). The village held a special place in Jesus' ministry, serving as a place of rest, friendship, and significant events. ¶In John 1:28, a different Bethany is mentioned, which is specified as \"Bethany beyond the Jordan.\" This Bethany was located on the eastern side of the Jordan River, where John the Baptist was baptizing people.

It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Joshua 19:27, as part of a description of the border of Asher's territory. ¶The name Beth-dagon suggests that the town was associated with the worship of Dagon, a Philistine deity often depicted as having the upper body of a man and the tail of a fish. Dagon was considered the god of fertility, agriculture, and storms. ¶The presence of a town named after Dagon within Asher's territory indicates the influence of Philistine culture and religion in the region. It is not uncommon for towns and cities in the ancient Near East to be named after the deities worshipped there. ¶The exact location of Beth-dagon in Asher is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the western part of the tribe's territory, near the Mediterranean coast. Asher's territory was located in the northwestern part of Canaan, bordering Phoenicia to the north. ¶No other details about the town or its history are provided in the Bible. The mention of Beth-dagon in Joshua 19:27 serves primarily to delineate the border of Asher's territory.",

The prophet Amos, in his prophecy against Damascus (the capital of Aram or Syria), declares that the Lord will break the gate bars of Damascus and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden. ¶The exact location of Beth-eden is not specified in the Bible, but it is associated with the rulers of Aram. The context suggests that it may have been a royal residence or a place of importance for the Aramean kings. ¶The reference to the \"one who holds the scepter\" indicates that Beth-eden was a seat of power or authority. The scepter is a symbol of kingship and rule, so the phrase implies that Beth-eden was a place from which the kings of Aram exercised their dominion. ¶Amos's prophecy against Aram was delivered during a time when the Arameans were a significant threat to Israel and Judah. The prophecy foretells the destruction of Damascus and the downfall of the Aramean rulers, including those associated with Beth-eden. ¶",

After Jehu had killed King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah, he set out to eliminate any potential rivals to his claim to the throne. ¶On his way to Samaria, Jehu came to Beth-eked, where he encountered forty-two brothers of Ahaziah. These men were likely coming to visit the royal family in Samaria, unaware of the recent coup. Jehu ordered his men to take the brothers alive and then slaughter them at the pit of Beth-eked. The text emphasizes that Jehu killed all forty-two men, leaving none of them alive. ¶The exact location of Beth-eked is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated between Jezreel and Samaria, possibly serving as a resting place for travelers or a center for sheep-shearing. The name \"Beth-eked\" suggests that it may have been a place where sheep were bound for shearing. ¶Jehu's actions at Beth-eked were part of his larger campaign to eliminate the house of Ahab and establish himself as the new king of Israel. His purge was seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Elijah against the house of Ahab (1 Kings 21:21-24). ¶",

It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Jacob. ¶The city was originally called Luz (Genesis 28:19; 35:6; 48:3; Judges 1:23) and was renamed Bethel by Jacob after his vision of a ladder reaching to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). In this vision, God confirmed the covenant He had made with Abraham and promised to be with Jacob wherever he went. Jacob set up a stone pillar at the site, anointed it with oil, and made a vow to God. ¶Abraham had previously built an altar between Bethel and Ai (Genesis 12:8; 13:3), and Jacob later returned to Bethel, where he built an altar and received a renewed promise from God (Genesis 35:1-15). The place was also called El-bethel, meaning \"God of Bethel\" (Genesis 35:7). ¶During the period of the judges, Deborah held court under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel (Judges 4:5), and the Israelites went up to Bethel to seek guidance from God (Judges 20:18, 26; 21:2). The Ark of the Covenant was temporarily located at Bethel (Judges 20:27). ¶After the division of the kingdom, Jeroboam I set up a golden calf at Bethel to prevent the people from going to Jerusalem to worship (1 Kings 12:28-33). This act led to Bethel becoming a major center of idolatry, and the prophets Amos and Hosea condemned the worship there (Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5-6; 7:10, 13; Hosea 10:5, 8, 15). ¶The city was called Aven, meaning \"wickedness,\" by Hosea (Hosea 10:8) and Beth-aven, meaning \"house of wickedness,\" in other passages (Joshua 7:2; 18:12; 1 Samuel 13:5; 14:23), likely referring to its association with idolatry. ¶Bethel was destroyed by King Josiah during his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:4, 15-19) but was later resettled after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32; 11:31). ¶The city was also known as Bochim, meaning \"weepers,\" in Judges 2:1, 5, where an angel of the Lord rebuked the Israelites for their disobedience. ¶Bethel played a significant role in Israel's history, serving as a place of worship, a center of idolatry, and a symbol of God's presence and promises to His people.",

The verse reads, \"Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether.\" ¶The exact location of the mountains of Bether is unknown, and there is no other mention of this place in the Bible or other historical sources. Some scholars suggest that \"Bether\" may not refer to a specific geographical location but rather serve as a symbolic or poetic term. ¶The word \"Bether\" comes from a Hebrew root meaning \"to divide\" or \"to cut,\" which has led some interpreters to understand the phrase \"mountains of Bether\" as referring to \"mountains of separation\" or \"cleft mountains.\" This interpretation would fit the context of the Song of Solomon, which explores themes of love, longing, and separation between the lovers. ¶In this view, the mountains of Bether represent the obstacles or distances that separate the lovers, and the beloved is invited to come swiftly, like a gazelle or young stag, to overcome these barriers. The imagery of the gazelle and stag also suggests the agility, grace, and strength needed to traverse the rugged terrain of the mountains. ¶Other interpretations propose that the mountains of Bether may refer to a specific location, possibly in the region of Lebanon or Anti-Lebanon, known for its rugged terrain and natural beauty. However, without further biblical or historical evidence, the precise location remains uncertain.",

        "ext_description": "Bethesda, also known as Bethzatha, was a pool located in Jerusalem, mentioned in the Gospel of John. The name Bethesda is derived from the Hebrew term meaning \"house of mercy\" or \"house of grace,\" while Bethzatha comes from the Aramaic, meaning \"house of olives\" or \"house of the olive tree.\" ¶The pool is described as having five roofed colonnades or porticoes, suggesting a structure with covered walkways surrounding the pool. It was located near the Sheep Gate, which was likely a gate in the northern wall of the city, used for bringing sheep into Jerusalem for sacrificial purposes. ¶In John 5:1-15, Jesus visits the Pool of Bethesda and encounters a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. The man explains that he has been unable to enter the pool when the water is stirred up, as someone else always steps in before him. It was believed that an angel would periodically come down and stir up the water, and the first person to enter the pool after this would be healed of their infirmities. ¶Jesus, seeing the man and knowing his long-standing condition, asks him, \"Do you want to get well?\" The man responds by explaining his inability to enter the pool first. Jesus then commands him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" Instantly, the man is healed, takes up his mat, and starts walking. ¶This miracle leads to a controversy, as it occurred on the Sabbath, and the Jewish leaders considered carrying a mat on the Sabbath to be a violation of the law. Jesus later finds the man in the temple and advises him to stop sinning, lest something worse happens to him. ¶The Pool of Bethesda is an example of Jesus' power to heal and his authority over the Sabbath. It also highlights the contrast between the man's long-standing infirmity and the instantaneous nature of Jesus' healing. ¶Archaeologists have uncovered a site near the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem, which is believed to be the location of the Pool of Bethesda. The excavations revealed a pool with multiple porticoes, consistent with the biblical description.",

The towns mentioned in the surrounding verses, such as Shaphir, Zaanan, and Maroth, are also believed to be in this general area. ¶Micah's prophecy suggests that Beth-ezel would be unable to provide support or refuge to the inhabitants of the nearby town of Zaanan during the coming judgment. The phrase \"the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place\" indicates that Beth-ezel itself would be affected by the calamity and unable to offer assistance. ¶The prophecy against Beth-ezel and the other towns in Judah serves as a warning of the impending judgment due to the people's sins and a call to repentance and humility before God.

Lower Beth-horon was situated in a strategic location along the main road connecting the coastal plain with Jerusalem and the interior of the country. ¶In the book of Joshua, Lower Beth-horon is described as part of the border between Ephraim and Benjamin (Joshua 16:3; 18:13). It was allotted to the Kohathite clan of the Levites (Joshua 21:22; 1 Chronicles 6:68). ¶The most famous biblical event associated with Lower Beth-horon is the battle between the Israelites and the Amorite kings, described in Joshua 10. As the Amorites fled before Israel, God cast down large hailstones on them, and Joshua prayed for the sun to stand still, allowing the Israelites to complete their victory (Joshua 10:10-11). ¶In later history, Lower Beth-horon was fortified by King Solomon (1 Kings 9:17; 2 Chronicles 8:5) and was the site of a battle between Judah and Israel during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah (2 Chronicles 25:13). ¶The Philistines also used the Beth-horon road as one of their main routes for invading Israelite territory (1 Samuel 13:18). ¶Both Lower and Upper Beth-horon were rebuilt by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:24). ¶Today, the ancient site of Lower Beth-horon is identified with the modern Palestinian village of Beit Ur al-Tahta.",

The name Bethlehem means \"house of bread,\" while Ephrath or Ephrathah means \"fruitful.\" ¶Bethlehem is first mentioned in the Bible as the burial place of Rachel, Jacob's wife (Genesis 35:19; 48:7). It was also the hometown of Ibzan, one of the judges of Israel (Judges 12:8, 10). ¶During the period of the judges, a Levite from Bethlehem became a priest for Micah's idolatrous shrine (Judges 17:7-9). Later, a Levite from Bethlehem traveled to Gibeah, where his concubine was mistreated, leading to a war between the Israelites and the Benjamites (Judges 19:1-2, 18). ¶The book of Ruth is set primarily in Bethlehem, where Naomi and her family were from (Ruth 1:1-2, 19, 22). Boaz, who married Ruth, was also from Bethlehem (Ruth 2:4; 4:11). ¶Bethlehem is most famously known as the hometown of King David (1 Samuel 16:1, 18; 17:12, 15; 20:6, 28). It was in Bethlehem that Samuel anointed David as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16:4). During David's reign, the city was referred to as the \"city of David\" (Luke 2:4, 11). ¶Several of David's mighty men, including Abishai and Elhanan, were from Bethlehem (2 Samuel 23:24; 1 Chronicles 11:26; 2 Samuel 21:19). ¶In the New Testament, Bethlehem is celebrated as the birthplace of Jesus Christ (Matthew 2:1, 5-6, 8, 16; Luke 2:4, 15; John 7:42). The Magi visited Jesus in Bethlehem, and King Herod ordered the massacre of the innocents there in an attempt to kill the newborn king (Matthew 2:16). ¶The prophet Micah foretold that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and this prophecy is cited in Matthew 2:5-6.",

The king left the city with his entire household, except for ten concubines who were left to take care of the palace. ¶David and his followers stopped at a place some distance from the city, which is referred to as Beth-merchak. The text does not provide the exact location of this place, but it was likely a short distance from Jerusalem, possibly a suburb or a neighboring village. ¶At Beth-merchak, David reviewed the people who were with him, including his servants and loyal followers.

It is mentioned in the context of Abimelech's rise to power and his subsequent conflict with the people of Shechem. ¶In Judges 9:6, the men of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered together to make Abimelech, the son of Gideon (Jerubbaal), king over them. This event took place by the terebinth tree at the pillar in Shechem, suggesting that Beth-millo was a significant part of the city and that its inhabitants had a say in the selection of their ruler. ¶However, the relationship between Abimelech and the people of Shechem and Beth-millo deteriorated over time. In Judges 9:20, Jotham, Abimelech's half-brother, prophesied that fire would come from Abimelech to devour the men of Shechem and Beth-millo and that fire would come from them to devour Abimelech. This prophecy came true when the men of Shechem turned against Abimelech and he, in turn, destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants (Judges 9:23-49). ¶The exact nature and location of Beth-millo within Shechem are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it may have been a fortified citadel or a residential area for the city's upper class. Others propose that it could have been a part of the city's defensive structures, such as a filled-in rampart or a tower. ¶The story of Abimelech and Beth-millo highlights the political instability and power struggles that characterized the period of the judges in Israel's history. It also demonstrates the consequences of making alliances with those who do not follow God's ways.",

However, the exact location of his grave remains unknown, as the text states that \"no one knows his grave to this day.\" ¶In Joshua 13:20, Beth-peor is mentioned as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben, along with other cities in the plains of Moab. ¶The name Beth-peor suggests that the place was associated with the worship of the Moabite god Peor. This connection is further supported by the events recorded in Numbers 25, where the Israelites engaged in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites, worshipping Baal of Peor. As a result, a plague struck the Israelites, and Moses was commanded to execute the leaders of the people. ¶The location of Beth-peor is not precisely known, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Mount Nebo, from where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death (Deuteronomy 34:1-4).",

It was from Bethphage that Jesus sent two of His disciples to retrieve a donkey and a colt, on which He would ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶The fact that Bethphage is mentioned alongside Bethany suggests that the two villages were in close proximity to each other. Bethany is known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11:1, 38-44). ¶The exact location of Bethphage is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, near the road leading from Jericho to Jerusalem. Its name, \"house of unripe figs,\" may refer to the presence of fig trees in the area or to a local feature associated with the cultivation or processing of figs. ¶Bethphage's significance in the Gospels lies in its role as the starting point for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which marked the beginning of the events leading up to His crucifixion and resurrection. The village's proximity to Jerusalem and its location on the Mount of Olives, a site of great prophetic and eschatological importance, further underscores its significance in the Gospel narrative.",

It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan and later during the reign of King David. ¶In Numbers 13:21, the spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan are said to have gone as far north as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. This suggests that Rehob was located in the northernmost part of the Promised Land, close to the entrance of Hamath, a major city in Syria. ¶In Judges 18:28, Rehob is mentioned as a reference point to describe the location of Laish, a city that the Danites conquered and renamed Dan. The text states that Laish was situated near Beth-rehob, indicating the proximity of the two places. ¶During the reign of King David, Beth-rehob played a role in the conflict between Israel and the Ammonites. In 2 Samuel 10:6, the Ammonites, facing an impending attack from David's army, hired Aramean mercenaries from various regions, including Beth-rehob, to help them in battle. The Arameans of Beth-rehob, along with those from Zobah, provided 20,000 foot soldiers to support the Ammonites. ¶In the subsequent battle at Helam (2 Samuel 10:8), the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, together with the Ammonites, faced David's army, led by Joab and Abishai. The Israelites defeated the Arameans and Ammonites, and the Arameans made peace with Israel, fearing to help the Ammonites any further. ¶The exact location of Beth-rehob is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Aram, north of Israel, possibly in the area known as the Beqaa Valley in modern-day Lebanon. Its association with the Arameans and its proximity to Hamath suggest that it was an important city or region in the Aramean kingdom.",

Jesus visited Bethsaida during His ministry and performed several miracles there, including healing a blind man (Mark 8:22-26). Bethsaida was one of the cities, along with Chorazin and Capernaum, that Jesus rebuked for their unbelief despite the mighty works He had done in their midst (Matthew 11:21, Luke 10:13). After the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus instructed His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida while He dismissed the crowd (Mark 6:45). The exact location of Bethsaida is debated, but it was likely situated near where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida's name derives from the Hebrew for \"house of fishing\" or \"house of hunting,\" reflecting its primary industry. The Bible portrays Bethsaida as a place of great spiritual opportunity that largely failed to respond to Jesus' message and miracles.",

The city was strategically positioned at the junction of the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys, controlling access to the Jezreel Valley from the east. ¶In Joshua 17:11 and 16, Beth-shean is listed among the cities and towns within Manasseh's inheritance that were not fully conquered by the Israelites. The Manassites were unable to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. ¶Judges 1:27 reiterates that Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites continued to live there. ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shean was included in the fifth administrative district overseen by Baana, son of Ahilud (1 Kings 4:12). The city's inclusion in this list suggests its ongoing importance and the presence of a significant Israelite population. ¶The most notable event associated with Beth-shean in the Bible is the aftermath of the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. In 1 Samuel 31:10-12, after Saul and his sons were killed in battle, the Philistines fastened their bodies to the wall of Beth-shean. When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard about this, they travelled through the night, took down the bodies, and buried them in Jabesh. ¶Later, during David's reign, the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan were retrieved from Jabesh-gilead and buried in the tomb of Saul's father, Kish, in Benjamin (2 Samuel 21:12-14). ¶Beth-shean's strategic location made it a target for conquest throughout history. The city was eventually captured by the Egyptians and later by the Assyrians. It was known as Scythopolis during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, serving as the leading city of the Decapolis, a group of ten Hellenistic cities in the region.",

It was allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:10) and later given to the Levites of the family of Aaron (Joshua 21:16; 1 Chronicles 6:59). ¶Beth-shemesh is primarily known for its association with the return of the Ark of the Covenant from the Philistines (1 Samuel 6). After the Ark had been captured by the Philistines, they sent it back on a cart, guided by two milk cows. The cows miraculously went straight to Beth-shemesh, where the people were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley (1 Samuel 6:9, 12-13). ¶The men of Beth-shemesh rejoiced when they saw the Ark, offering the cows as a burnt offering and sacrificing to the Lord (1 Samuel 6:14-15). However, some of the men looked inside the Ark, and as a result, God struck down 70 men (some manuscripts say 50,070) for their irreverence (1 Samuel 6:19-20). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shemesh was included in the second administrative district overseen by Ben-Deker (1 Kings 4:9). ¶Later, during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah, a battle took place between Amaziah and King Jehoash of Israel at Beth-shemesh. Amaziah was defeated and captured by Jehoash, who then proceeded to break down a section of the wall of Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:11-13; 2 Chronicles 25:21-23). ¶In the time of King Ahaz of Judah, the Philistines invaded the cities of the Shephelah, including Beth-shemesh, capturing and occupying them (2 Chronicles 28:18). ¶The city of Beth-shemesh is also mentioned in Judges 1:35, where it is stated that the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. Mount Heres, meaning \"mount of the sun,\" is likely another name for Beth-shemesh or the hill on which it was located.",

The people of Beth-togarmah are described as supplying horses, war horses, and mules to the markets of Tyre. This suggests that Beth-togarmah was known for its livestock, particularly horses, and that it had a significant role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network. ¶The exact location of Beth-togarmah is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Armenia or Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Some scholars propose that the name \"Beth-togarmah\" may be related to the Anatolian city of Tegarama, known from Hittite texts, or to the Armenian city of Tilgarimmu, mentioned in Assyrian records. ¶In Ezekiel 38:6, Beth-togarmah is mentioned again, this time in the context of a prophetic vision about a future invasion of Israel by a coalition of nations led by Gog, from the land of Magog. Beth-togarmah is described as being \"from the far north,\" along with Gomer and its troops, suggesting a geographical location north of Israel. This prophecy portrays Beth-togarmah as one of the allies of Gog in the latter days, participating in the attack on Israel. ¶The prophecy in Ezekiel 38-39 is often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, with Gog and its allies representing the nations that oppose God and His people. The ultimate defeat of Gog and its allies, including Beth-togarmah, emphasizes God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph of His kingdom.",

This fortification was part of Rehoboam's strategy to strengthen his kingdom against potential threats from the northern tribes of Israel and neighboring nations. ¶Later, in the time of Nehemiah, after the return from the Babylonian exile, Beth-zur was one of the towns whose walls were repaired (Nehemiah 3:16). The mention of Beth-zur in this context suggests that it had been inhabited before the exile and was being restored as part of the rebuilding of Judah. ¶The exact location of Beth-zur is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the ancient city of Hebron.

Jeremiah foretells that Bozrah would become a desolation and a curse, with its inhabitants fleeing in terror (Jeremiah 49:13, 22). Amos declares that God would send fire upon Bozrah, consuming its palaces (Amos 1:12). ¶The exact location of Bozrah is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern town of Busaira in southern Jordan. It should not be confused with the Levitical city of Bezer, also called Bozrah, in the territory of Reuben (Deuteronomy 4:43, Joshua 20:8).",

One choir went past the Broad Wall to the Ephraim Gate (Nehemiah 12:38), indicating that the Broad Wall was located in the northern part of the city, possibly near the Temple area. ¶The Broad Wall's construction and repair were part of Nehemiah's efforts to restore Jerusalem's defenses and rebuild the city after the Babylonian exile.

It was built by Herod the Great between 22 and 10 BC and named in honor of Augustus Caesar. Caesarea served as the capital of the Roman province of Judea and the official residence of the Roman governors. ¶In the New Testament, Caesarea is mentioned several times in the book of Acts. Philip the evangelist settled in Caesarea after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:40). The apostle Peter visited Caesarea and preached to the Gentile centurion Cornelius, leading to his conversion (Acts 10:1-48). Paul passed through Caesarea on his missionary journeys (Acts 9:30; 18:22) and was later imprisoned there for two years before being sent to Rome for trial (Acts 23:23-26:32). ¶Caesarea was known for its impressive harbor, which was constructed using advanced Roman engineering techniques. The city also featured a temple dedicated to Augustus, an amphitheater, a hippodrome, and a Roman aqueduct. As a center of Roman administration and a hub for trade, Caesarea played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity and the interaction between the Jewish and Gentile believers.",

It was later rebuilt and renamed Caesarea Philippi by Philip the Tetrarch, son of Herod the Great, in honor of himself and the Roman emperor. The city was known for its temple dedicated to Pan and its proximity to a large spring that fed the Jordan River. ¶Jesus' conversation with his disciples at Caesarea Philippi marked a turning point in his ministry. It was here that he began to reveal more openly his identity as the Messiah and his impending death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31).

Some scholars identify it with the ancient city of Kullania or Kullanhu, known from Assyrian inscriptions, which was located near the Tigris River. ¶In the Bible, Calneh is mentioned alongside other notable cities such as Babel, Erech, and Accad, suggesting its importance in the ancient Near Eastern world. The prophet Amos used Calneh as an example of a great city that had fallen, warning Israel of impending judgment (Amos 6:2). Similarly, Isaiah mentioned Calneh in the context of Assyria's conquests and its arrogance against God (Isaiah 10:9). ¶Ezekiel's reference to Calneh as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23) indicates that the city was involved in commercial activities and had established economic ties with other major centers in the region. ¶Although the biblical references to Calneh are brief, they suggest that it was a city of considerable significance in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its political, economic, and cultural importance.

As a region, Canaan was the ancient name for the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, roughly corresponding to modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Syria and Jordan. It was the land God promised to give to Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:5-7; 17:8). ¶The Canaanites were the descendants of Canaan, the grandson of Noah through Ham (Genesis 10:18-19). They were known for their idolatry and wickedness, which led to God commanding the Israelites to drive them out of the land (Deuteronomy 20:17). The term \"Canaanite\" was also used to refer to merchants or traders (Job 41:6; Proverbs 31:24), possibly due to their reputation for trading. ¶After the Exodus, the Israelites conquered parts of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, but they failed to completely drive out the Canaanites (Judges 1:27-36). This led to ongoing conflicts and religious influences throughout Israel's history. The prophets often rebuked Israel for adopting Canaanite practices and worshipping their gods (Ezekiel 16:3).",

Despite the numerous miracles and teachings, the people of Capernaum did not repent, leading Jesus to rebuke the city for its unbelief (Matthew 11:23; Luke 10:15). ¶The ruins of ancient Capernaum have been excavated, revealing the remains of a synagogue dating to the 4th or 5th century AD, built on the foundation of an earlier synagogue from the time of Jesus.

According to Amos 9:7, the Philistines originated from Caphtor, and Jeremiah 47:4 refers to \"the remnant of the country of Caphtor,\" linking the Philistines to this island. ¶In Deuteronomy 2:23, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, are described as destroying the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settling in their place. This suggests that the Philistines, who are known to have settled in the coastal region of Canaan, trace their ancestry back to Caphtor. ¶In the New Testament, Crete is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's travels. During his journey to Rome, Paul's ship sailed along the southern coast of Crete (Acts 27:7-13), and they sought to winter in the Cretan harbor of Phoenix (Acts 27:12). After the ship encountered a storm and was wrecked on the island of Malta, Paul continued his journey and eventually passed by Crete again (Acts 27:21). ¶Paul also left his companion Titus on Crete to organize the church and appoint elders in every town (Titus 1:5). In his letter to Titus, Paul quotes a Cretan prophet who described Cretans as \"always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons\" (Titus 1:12), indicating the challenges Titus faced in ministering to the people of Crete. ¶On the day of Pentecost, Cretans were among the people present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11).",

These believers were likely converts from the Jewish diaspora and Gentile proselytes. ¶Cappadocia was known for its unique geological features, including underground cities and rock-cut churches, many of which were used by early Christians as hiding places during times of persecution.

In Jeremiah 46:2, the prophet describes the decisive battle at Carchemish between the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar and the Egyptians in 605 BC. The Babylonian victory marked the end of Egyptian influence in the region and the beginning of Babylonian supremacy. ¶Archaeologically, Carchemish has been identified with the modern site of Karkamış in southeastern Turkey.

        "ext_description": "Carmel, also known as Racal, was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:55). It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in relation to David's life. Carmel was the home of Nabal, a wealthy but foolish man who refused to assist David and his men (1 Samuel 25:2-11). Nabal's wife, Abigail, intervened and provided for David's needs, demonstrating her wisdom and resourcefulness (1 Samuel 25:14-35). ¶After Nabal's death, David married Abigail, and she became one of his wives (1 Samuel 25:40-42). Later, when David was fleeing from Saul, he sent his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, to stay in Carmel (1 Samuel 27:3). The town is also mentioned in the list of places that received spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites (1 Samuel 30:29). ¶In the Song of Solomon, the beauty of the bride's head is compared to Mount Carmel (Song of Solomon 7:5), likely referring to the lush vegetation and majesty of the mountain. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Nahum use Carmel as a symbol of fertility, beauty, and God's judgment (Isaiah 33:9, 35:2; Jeremiah 46:18, 50:19; Amos 1:2, 9:3; Nahum 1:4).",

It is most famously associated with the prophet Elijah and his confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:19-40). On Mount Carmel, Elijah challenged the people of Israel to choose between the Lord and Baal, and he demonstrated the power of the true God by calling down fire from heaven. ¶After the contest, Elijah slaughtered the prophets of Baal at the Brook Kishon (1 Kings 18:40) and then went to the top of Mount Carmel to pray for rain, ending a three-year drought (1 Kings 18:42-45). The mountain is also mentioned in 2 Kings 2:25 and 4:25, in connection with the prophet Elisha, who was Elijah's successor. ¶Mount Carmel's lush vegetation and beauty made it a symbol of fertility and God's blessing in the Bible (Isaiah 35:2; Jeremiah 50:19; Amos 9:3). The mountain's strategic location and natural resources also made it a place of military and political significance throughout history.",

At the river Ahava, Ezra discovered that there were no Levites among the returning exiles (Ezra 8:15). ¶Ezra then sent a delegation to Casiphia, where a man named Iddo was the leader, to request that Levites be sent to join the returning group (Ezra 8:17). In response to this request, a number of Levites and temple servants were sent from Casiphia to accompany Ezra and the other exiles to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:18-20). ¶The exact location of Casiphia is unknown, but it was likely a settlement in Babylon where a community of Levites lived during the exile.

This measure was taken to prevent the ship from being run aground on the nearby Syrtis Sands, a notorious sandbar off the coast of North Africa. ¶Cauda is a small island located south of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea.

This vow was likely a Nazirite vow (Numbers 6:1-21), which involved abstaining from cutting one's hair until the vow was completed. Paul's actions at Cenchreae indicate his continued observance of Jewish customs and his commitment to his Jewish heritage. ¶In Romans 16:1-2, Paul commends Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchreae, to the believers in Rome. He describes her as a servant of the church and a benefactor to many, including Paul himself.

The Chaldeans were known for their expertise in astrology, astronomy, and other forms of wisdom. In the Bible, the term \"Chaldean\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"Babylonian\" or to refer specifically to astrologers and wise men from Babylon. ¶The Chaldeans played a significant role in the history of Israel, particularly during the Babylonian exile. In 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, conquered Judah and deported many of its inhabitants to Chaldea (2 Kings 24:1-2). The prophet Jeremiah warned the people of Judah about the impending Chaldean invasion and the 70-year exile that would follow (Jeremiah 25:11-12). ¶During the exile, some Jews, such as Daniel and his companions, were chosen to serve in the Chaldean court due to their wisdom and knowledge (Daniel 1:3-4). The Chaldeans are also mentioned in connection with the interpretation of dreams and visions (Daniel 2:2-10; 4:7; 5:7-11). ¶The Chaldeans were also known for their military might and their role in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10). However, the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah foretold the eventual downfall of Chaldea at the hands of the Medes and Persians (Isaiah 13:19; 47:1-5; Jeremiah 50:1-51:64).",

Joshua and the leaders of Israel made a treaty with them without consulting the Lord, only to discover later that the Gibeonites were actually their neighbors. ¶As a result of the treaty, the Gibeonites were spared but were assigned to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and the altar of the Lord (Joshua 9:27). Chephirah, along with the other Gibeonite cities, was initially allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:26) but later became part of the territory of Judah. ¶After the Babylonian exile, the descendants of the Gibeonites, including those from Chephirah, returned to their cities and were counted among the people of Israel (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). The town's mention in these post-exilic records indicates that it was still inhabited and recognized as a distinct community during the Persian period.",

The exact location of the brook is uncertain, but it was likely one of the many wadis or seasonal streams that flowed into the Jordan River from the mountains of Gilead. ¶This event demonstrates God's faithfulness in providing for His servant during a time of hardship and judgment.

The Brook Cherith served as a place of refuge and sustenance for Elijah, preparing him for his subsequent confrontations with Ahab and the prophets of Baal.",

This suggests that during the Babylonian captivity, some Jews may have settled in Cherub and other nearby towns, and over time, their family records were lost or destroyed. ¶The exact location of Cherub is unknown, but it was likely a small town or village in Babylonia, where a community of Jewish exiles had lived during the captivity. The name \"Cherub\" may be derived from the Akkadian word \"kāribu,\" which means \"intercessor\" or \"one who blesses,\" possibly indicating a religious significance of the town in Babylonian culture. ¶The mention of Cherub in the lists of returning exiles highlights the challenges faced by some Jews in proving their heritage and the diversity of locations from which they returned to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.",

The lake is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, fed by the Jordan River, and is approximately 13 miles (21 kilometers) long and 8 miles (13 kilometers) wide. ¶In the Old Testament, the lake is referred to as the Sea of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 13:27) or Chinneroth (Joshua 12:3), likely named after a nearby town. The name \"Chinnereth\" may be derived from the Hebrew word for \"harp,\" possibly referring to the shape of the lake. ¶In the New Testament, the lake is most commonly known as the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18; Mark 1:16; John 6:1) and is the setting for many events in Jesus' life and ministry. Jesus called his first disciples, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, while they were fishing on the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18-22). He also calmed a storm on the lake (Mark 4:35-41), walked on its waters (John 6:16-21), and appeared to his disciples on its shores after his resurrection (John 21:1-14). ¶The lake is also referred to as the Sea of Tiberias (John 6:1; 21:1), named after the city of Tiberias, which was founded on its western shore during the reign of Herod Antipas (circa 20 CE). The city was named in honor of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. ¶The Sea of Galilee was an important source of livelihood for the people in the region, with fishing being a major industry. Several of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were fishermen on the lake (Luke 5:1-11). The lake's shores were also dotted with numerous towns and villages, such as Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Magdala, which feature prominently in the Gospels.",

This suggests that Chinnereth was a significant city in the region during the time of the conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The Sea of Chinnereth, later known as the Sea of Galilee, was named after the city or region of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Deuteronomy 3:17). This sea played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus Christ, as he performed many miracles and taught in the towns and villages along its shores. ¶In 1 Kings 15:20, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, attacked several cities in northern Israel, including \"all Chinneroth,\" referring to the region around the Sea of Galilee.

This suggests that Jesus had carried out significant miracles and teachings in Chorazin, yet the people remained unresponsive to his message. ¶Jesus then declares that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for Chorazin, emphasizing the severity of the town's spiritual hardness and the consequences of rejecting the Messiah. ¶The exact location of Chorazin is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be the modern-day site of Khirbet Karazeh, about 2.5 miles north of Capernaum. Archaeological excavations at the site have revealed the remains of a synagogue from the 3rd or 4th century AD, as well as residential buildings and streets. ¶Chorazin serves as a sobering example of the consequences of unbelief and the importance of responding to Jesus' teachings and miracles with faith and repentance.",

Paul was born in Tarsus, one of the chief cities of Cilicia (Acts 21:39; 22:3). After his conversion, Paul spent some time in Cilicia (Galatians 1:21; Acts 9:30) and later revisited the region during his second missionary journey, strengthening the churches (Acts 15:41). ¶Cilicia had a significant Jewish population, and the synagogue of the Cilicians in Jerusalem was among those who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). The early Christian church spread to Cilicia, as evidenced by the letter addressed to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (Acts 15:23). ¶Geographically, Cilicia was an important region, serving as a major trade route between Syria and the west. The Cilician Gates, a mountain pass through the Taurus Mountains, was a strategic point of travel and was likely used by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journeys (Acts 15:41).",

        "ext_description": "Colossae was an ancient city located in the Lycus Valley in the region of Phrygia, in western Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It is most notably known as the recipient of one of Paul's epistles, the Letter to the Colossians. ¶In the opening of the epistle (Colossians 1:2), Paul addresses the letter to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colossae. The church in Colossae was likely established during Paul's third missionary journey, as he spent two years teaching in Ephesus, and the gospel spread throughout the region (Acts 19:10). ¶Although Paul had not personally visited Colossae (Colossians 2:1), he had heard about the faith and love of the Colossian believers through Epaphras, who was likely the founder of the church (Colossians 1:7-8). Epaphras had informed Paul of some concerns regarding false teachings that were influencing the Colossian church, prompting Paul to write the epistle. ¶In the letter, Paul emphasizes the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ, warning against false philosophies and human traditions that could lead believers astray (Colossians 2:8-23). He also provides practical instructions for Christian living, including relationships within families and between slaves and masters (Colossians 3:1-4:6). ¶The closing of the letter (Colossians 4:18) includes a personal greeting from Paul, written in his own hand, and a request for the Colossians to exchange letters with the church in Laodicea, another nearby city. ¶Colossae was known for its wool and dye industry, particularly a unique purple dye called colossinus. The city was also located near the important trade routes that connected Ephesus to the Euphrates River. However, by the time of Paul's writing, Colossae had declined in importance compared to the nearby cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis.",

        "ext_description": "Corban is a term that appears in the New Testament with two related meanings. In Mark 7:11, Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for using the concept of Corban to avoid their responsibility to support their parents. The Pharisees would declare their property or assets as \"Corban,\" meaning it was dedicated to God, and thus exempt from being used to help their parents, even though they could still benefit from it themselves. Jesus condemns this practice as a way of nullifying God's commandment to honor one's father and mother. ¶The term Corban is derived from the Hebrew word \"qorban,\" which means \"offering\" or \"sacrifice.\" In the Old Testament, it refers to various offerings and sacrifices brought to the temple as an act of worship and devotion to God. ¶In Matthew 27:6, the term Corban appears again, this time referring to the temple treasury. After Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver he had received for betraying Jesus, the chief priests decided that it was not lawful to put the money into the treasury (Corban) because it was the price of blood. This indicates that the temple treasury was considered sacred, and there were regulations concerning the source and use of funds placed in it.",

It was known for its strategic location, controlling trade routes between the Aegean and Adriatic seas. The city was famous for its wealth, luxury, and immorality. ¶In the New Testament, Corinth plays a significant role as the location of a Christian church founded by the apostle Paul during his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1-18). Paul spent 18 months in Corinth, working as a tentmaker and preaching the gospel. Many Corinthians, including Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed and were baptized (Acts 18:8). ¶After leaving Corinth, Paul wrote two epistles to the church, known as 1 and 2 Corinthians. These letters address various issues faced by the Corinthian believers, including divisions, immorality, lawsuits, and questions about spiritual gifts, resurrection, and Christian conduct. ¶In Romans 16:27, Paul sends greetings to the Corinthians, indicating that he wrote the epistle to the Romans while in Corinth. In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Erastus in Corinth, suggesting that the city continued to have a Christian presence. ¶Throughout the epistles, Paul refers to the Corinthian believers with affection, calling them \"saints\" (1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:1) and expressing his love for them (2 Corinthians 6:11; 13:13-14). The correspondence between Paul and the Corinthian church provides valuable insights into the challenges and growth of the early Christian community in a significant Gentile city.",

It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in connection with repairs made to the city's fortifications and measurements of the city's perimeter. ¶In 2 Kings 14:13 and 2 Chronicles 25:23, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the points from which King Jehoash of Israel broke down the wall of Jerusalem after defeating King Amaziah of Judah. This suggests that the Corner Gate was a significant and strategic point in the city's defenses. ¶During the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, the Corner Gate was fortified and towers were built near it (2 Chronicles 26:9). This further emphasizes the gate's importance in the city's defensive structure. ¶In the book of Jeremiah, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the landmarks in the prophetic description of Jerusalem's future restoration (Jeremiah 31:38). This passage envisions a time when the city will be rebuilt and expanded, with the Corner Gate marking one of the boundaries of the renewed city. ¶The exact location of the Corner Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated at a point where the city wall turned a corner, hence its name. Some scholars suggest that it may have been located near the northwest corner of the city, possibly close to the present-day Jaffa Gate.",

The next day, they went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. This brief mention of Cos provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions as they navigated the islands of the Aegean Sea. ¶Cos was known in ancient times for its strategic location, fertile land, and medical school associated with Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician. The island was also a center of the worship of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities or experiences on Cos, the mention of the island in the context of his journey demonstrates the apostle's determination to return to Jerusalem, despite the warnings he had received about the hardships that awaited him there (Acts 20:22-23; 21:4, 11-14). The inclusion of Cos in the itinerary also highlights the extensive travel and maritime connections in the ancient Mediterranean world, which facilitated the spread of the gospel.",

This event occurred around 722 BC when the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and exiled a significant portion of its population. ¶The people of Cuthah, along with those from other Babylonian cities such as Babylon, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, were relocated to Samaria. These settlers, who came to be known as the Samaritans, initially did not worship the Lord and instead continued to serve their own gods (2 Kings 17:29-31). ¶In response to the settlers' lack of reverence for the Lord, God sent lions among them, which killed some of the people. When the king of Assyria was informed of this, he ordered that one of the priests from among the exiled Israelites be sent back to Samaria to teach the new inhabitants about the God of the land (2 Kings 17:25-28). ¶As a result, the Samaritans developed a syncretic religion, combining elements of their own beliefs with the worship of the Lord (2 Kings 17:32-34, 41). This mixed religious practice led to ongoing tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile, as evidenced in the New Testament (e.g., John 4:9). ¶The mention of Cuthah in the Bible provides insight into the complex history of the Samaritan people and the religious and cultural dynamics that shaped the region after the Assyrian conquest of Israel.",

Ezekiel 27:6 mentions the use of ivory from the coasts of Elishah (possibly Cyprus) in the construction of ships. ¶In Numbers 24:24 and Daniel 11:30, Kittim is associated with ships that come against the people of God, possibly referring to the island's role in military campaigns or as a base for hostile forces. ¶In the New Testament, Cyprus plays a significant role in the spread of early Christianity. The apostle Barnabas, a Levite from Cyprus (Acts 4:36), and some unnamed believers from the island were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch (Acts 11:19-20). Barnabas and Saul (Paul) visited Cyprus during their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4), where they encountered the sorcerer Elymas and converted the proconsul Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-12). ¶Later, Barnabas and Mark sailed to Cyprus after a disagreement with Paul (Acts 15:39). Paul also visited the island during his third missionary journey (Acts 21:3) and during his journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:4). ¶The early Christian community in Cyprus included Mnason, an early disciple who provided lodging for Paul and his companions in Jerusalem (Acts 21:16).",

Damascus was involved in conflicts with Israel and Judah, often aligning with their enemies (1 Kings 15:18; 2 Kings 16:9). The city was known for its beauty and prosperity, with references to its fertile gardens and bustling trade (Song of Solomon 7:4; Ezekiel 27:18). In the New Testament, Damascus is significant as the place of Paul's conversion on the road to the city (Acts 9:1-19). The city played a crucial role in the early spread of Christianity, with Paul spending time there after his conversion (Galatians 1:17).",

Later, Caleb offered his daughter Achsah in marriage to whoever would capture Debir, and Othniel, Caleb's nephew, successfully took the city (Joshua 15:15-16; Judges 1:11-12). The city was also known as Kiriath-sannah, meaning \"city of palm,\" and Kiriath-sepher, meaning \"city of books,\" possibly indicating it was a center of learning. After its capture, Debir was allotted to the priests (Joshua 21:15; 1 Chronicles 6:58).",

The East was also the direction from which the Babylonians and Persians came to conquer and exile the people of Judah.

After the conquest of Canaan, Joshua led the Israelites in fulfilling this command, building an altar on Mount Ebal and conducting the ceremony as prescribed (Joshua 8:30, 33). In the time of Abimelech, Mount Zalmon (another name for Mount Ebal) was the site where he and his men cut down branches to set fire to the tower of Shechem (Judges 9:48).

When the Philistines attacked again, God intervened on behalf of Israel, causing confusion among the Philistines and leading to their defeat (1 Samuel 7:7-11). To commemorate this divine intervention and victory, Samuel set up the stone and named it Ebenezer, acknowledging God's help and deliverance (1 Samuel 7:12).

God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it (Genesis 2:15). The garden contained various trees, including the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:9). After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:23-24). Cherubim and a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden to guard the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24). The Garden of Eden is mentioned in later biblical passages as a symbol of perfect beauty, abundance, and God's ideal for His creation (Isaiah 51:3; Ezekiel 28:13; 31:9, 16, 18; 36:35; Joel 2:3).

In the Bible, Egypt is first mentioned as the place Abraham journeyed during a famine in Canaan (Genesis 12:10). Later, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt but rose to power as a trusted official of Pharaoh. During a famine, Jacob and his family settled in Egypt with Joseph. ¶After generations passed, the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptians (Exodus 1:8-14). God called Moses to deliver His people from bondage. After Pharaoh refused to free the Israelites, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt (Exodus 7-12). Finally, Pharaoh relented and the Israelites left in the Exodus. At the Red Sea, God miraculously allowed the Israelites to cross on dry ground but destroyed the pursuing Egyptian army (Exodus 14). ¶Egypt is often used in the Bible as a symbol of bondage and oppression. The prophets warned against trusting in Egypt's power instead of God (Isaiah 30:1-3, 31:1). Yet Egypt was also a place of refuge, as when Mary, Joseph and Jesus fled there to escape Herod (Matthew 2:13-15).",

In response, Chedorlaomer and his allies, including Arioch of Ellasar, went to war against them in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea/Dead Sea region). The cities of the plain were defeated, and Sodom and Gomorrah were plundered. Lot, Abraham's nephew living in Sodom, was taken captive. ¶When Abraham heard of Lot's capture, he pursued Chedorlaomer's forces with his 318 trained men and defeated them near Damascus, rescuing Lot and recovering the goods and people taken from Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 14:13-16). ¶The exact location of Ellasar is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Mesopotamia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Larsa in southern Babylonia.

As they walked, Jesus Himself joined them, but they did not recognize Him. Jesus explained to them the prophecies concerning the Messiah in the Scriptures. When they reached Emmaus, the disciples urged Jesus to stay with them, and as He broke bread with them, their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him (Luk. 24:13-35). The exact location of Emmaus is uncertain, as there are several possible sites that have been proposed based on ancient traditions and archaeological evidence.",

When Judah later sought to find the supposed prostitute, he was told that there was no cult prostitute in Enaim (Gen. 38:21-22).

It played a significant role in two events related to the succession of King David's throne. ¶First, Adonijah, one of David's sons, attempted to establish himself as king at En-rogel without David's knowledge or consent (1 Kings 1:9). Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Stone of Zoheleth, which was near En-rogel, and invited his brothers and the king's officials to support his claim to the throne. However, his attempt was thwarted when the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba informed David of the situation, leading to Solomon being anointed as king (1 Kings 1:11-40). ¶Later, during Absalom's rebellion against David, En-rogel served as a meeting place for David's supporters, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (2 Samuel 17:17). They would bring information from the city to David, who had fled from Jerusalem. A servant girl would go and tell them the information, and they would then go and tell King David, to avoid being seen entering the city. ¶The name En-rogel means \"spring of the fuller\" or \"fountain of the treader,\" possibly referring to the presence of a water source used for washing or treading clothes. Its exact location is debated, but it is believed to be either the modern-day Bir Ayub (Job's Well) or the Virgin's Spring (Gihon Spring) in the Kidron Valley, south of the City of David.",

With a sling and a stone, David defeated Goliath, leading to a great victory for the Israelites over the Philistines (1 Samuel 17:48-53). ¶The alternate name Pas-dammim, used in 1 Chronicles 11:13, may be a variant spelling or a scribal error.

It was one of the largest and most important cities in the Roman province of Asia and played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity. ¶The apostle Paul visited Ephesus during his second and third missionary journeys (Acts 18:19-21; 19:1-41). During his third journey, Paul stayed in Ephesus for over two years, preaching the gospel and establishing a strong Christian community (Acts 19:8-10). Many Ephesians turned from their pagan practices and embraced the faith, which led to a decline in the sale of silver shrines of the goddess Artemis (Diana), causing a riot instigated by the silversmiths (Acts 19:23-41). ¶Paul later wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians, one of his prison epistles, to strengthen and encourage the believers in Ephesus (Ephesians 1:1). In this letter, Paul expounds on the nature of the church, the unity of believers in Christ, and the importance of living a life worthy of the calling they had received. ¶Ephesus was also one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 1:11; 2:1-7). In the message to the church in Ephesus, the risen Christ commends their hard work and perseverance but admonishes them for having forsaken their first love and calls them to repent and return to their former devotion. ¶The city was famous for its Temple of Artemis (Diana), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (Acts 19:35). It was also an important center of learning, with a renowned library. Today, the ruins of Ephesus, including the remains of the theater where the riot took place (Acts 19:29), are a popular tourist attraction and a testament to the city's rich history and its role in the early Christian church.",

This action was likely meant to humiliate Judah and demonstrate Israel's military superiority. ¶The Ephraim Gate was probably located on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim.

The destruction of this portion of the wall would have left Jerusalem vulnerable and symbolized the weakened state of Judah under Amaziah's rule.",

The public reading of the Law was an important event in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community after their return from exile. ¶Nehemiah 12:39 describes a dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall, during which two processions of singers and musicians marched along the top of the wall in opposite directions, meeting at the Ephraim Gate before proceeding to the Temple. ¶The Ephraim Gate's location is not specified, but it was likely on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim.

Nimrod, a mighty hunter and ruler, is described as establishing a powerful kingdom that included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. ¶Ezra 4:9 mentions the people of Erech among those who wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and the city walls after the Babylonian exile. This suggests that inhabitants of Erech were among those deported and resettled in other parts of the Persian Empire, and they sought to hinder the Jewish returnees' efforts to reestablish their homeland. ¶Archaeologically, Erech is one of the oldest cities in Mesopotamia, with evidence of continuous habitation from the 5th millennium BC. It was an important center of Sumerian culture and religion, known for its impressive ziggurats and the Gilgamesh Epic, one of the earliest known works of literature. ¶The biblical mentions of Erech, though brief, attest to its significance as an ancient Mesopotamian city and its interaction with the history and people of Israel, both in the early stages of civilization and during the post-exilic period.",

The Edomites had rejoiced over Judah's destruction and had even participated in looting the city and capturing fleeing Israelites (Obadiah 1:11-14). ¶Obadiah prophesies that God will bring down the \"wise men\" and \"mighty men\" of Edom, and that their mountain stronghold will be unable to protect them from divine judgment (Obadiah 1:8-9). He also foretells that the house of Jacob and Joseph will possess the territories of Edom and the surrounding nations, and that deliverers will come from Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau (Obadiah 1:19, 21). ¶The reference to Mount Esau symbolizes the pride and security of the Edomites in their mountainous territory, as well as their opposition to God's people.

It was initially allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:33) but was later assigned to the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:41). ¶Eshtaol is particularly associated with the story of Samson, the legendary Israelite judge. Samson was born in the nearby town of Zorah and is described as moving between Zorah and Eshtaol, where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him (Judges 13:25). After Samson's death, he was buried between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father, Manoah (Judges 16:31). ¶Eshtaol also played a role in the Danite migration narrative. Due to limited territory and pressure from the Philistines, a group of Danites sent spies from Zorah and Eshtaol to search for a new land to settle (Judges 18:2). After the spies returned with a favorable report, six hundred men from the clan of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol to conquer the city of Laish in the north (Judges 18:8, 11). ¶The descendants of the Eshtaolites, a clan from Eshtaol, are mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:53 among the descendants of Judah's son Shobal.

In 1 Chronicles 4:17, Ishbah is mentioned as the father of Eshtemoa. Later, in 1 Chronicles 4:19, the sons of Ezrah are listed, including Eshtemoa. ¶During the time of David, when he was hiding from King Saul in the wilderness of Judah, David sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to the elders of Eshtemoa, among other cities (1 Samuel 30:28). This act of sharing the spoils was likely a gesture of goodwill and a way to strengthen alliances with the cities that had supported him. ¶The exact location of Eshtemoa is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the modern-day village of es-Semu'a, about 15 kilometers south of Hebron. As a Levitical city, Eshtemoa would have played a role in the religious life of the surrounding region, with the Levites serving as teachers, judges, and spiritual leaders.",

It was the site of several significant events, such as the battle of Carchemish, where the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians (Jeremiah 46:2), and the place where Jeremiah hid a linen belt as a symbol of God's judgment on Judah (Jeremiah 13:4-7). ¶In the book of Revelation, the Euphrates is mentioned in connection with the sixth trumpet judgment (Revelation 9:14) and the sixth bowl judgment (Revelation 16:12), where the river is dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east. ¶Throughout the Bible, the Euphrates is used as a symbol of the extent of God's promised blessings (Psalm 72:8), the reach of Israel's enemies (Isaiah 7:20; 8:7), and the future restoration of Israel (Isaiah 11:15; 27:12; Micah 7:12; Zechariah 9:10). ¶The Euphrates played a significant role in the history and commerce of the ancient Near East, with many important cities and civilizations situated along its banks, such as Babylon, Ur, and Carchemish. It was a vital source of water for irrigation and transportation, and its fertile floodplains supported agriculture and trade.",

The name \"Ezel\" may be derived from the Hebrew word \"azel,\" meaning \"departure\" or \"going away,\" possibly referring to David's intended departure from Saul's court. ¶In the context of the narrative, David had become aware of Saul's intention to harm him and sought Jonathan's help to determine the king's true intentions. Jonathan devised a plan to shoot arrows near the Stone of Ezel as a signal to David. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were on the near side of the stone, it would indicate that David was safe to return. However, if Jonathan said that the arrows were beyond the stone, it would mean that David should flee for his life (1 Samuel 20:20-22). ¶The exact location of the Stone of Ezel is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in a field near Gibeah, Saul's hometown, where David and Jonathan could meet without arousing suspicion. The stone may have served as a boundary marker or a prominent landmark that could be easily identified. ¶The Stone of Ezel incident demonstrates the deep friendship between David and Jonathan and their loyalty to each other, even in the face of Saul's hostility. It also showcases their trust in God and their willingness to communicate and act in wisdom to protect David's life.",

After passing Cape Salmone, they arrived at Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea (Acts 27:8). ¶While at Fair Havens, Paul advised the crew to spend the winter there, as he foresaw that continuing the voyage would result in damage and loss (Acts 27:9-10). However, the centurion in charge of the ship decided to follow the advice of the pilot and the ship's owner, who wanted to reach Phoenix, another harbor on Crete, to spend the winter (Acts 27:11-12). ¶The exact location of Fair Havens is believed to be near the modern-day village of Kaloi Limenes, which bears the same name as the ancient harbor.

The Fish Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:39, where it is listed among the gates that the procession of dedication passed through during the celebration of the completed wall. ¶The name \"Fish Gate\" suggests that it may have been a location where fish were sold or where fishermen entered the city to sell their catch. It is possible that the gate was named after the nearby fish market or the road leading to the Mediterranean Sea, where fish were brought into the city. ¶In Zephaniah 1:10, the Fish Gate is mentioned in a prophecy of judgment against Jerusalem, where the Lord declares that a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, along with wailing from the Second Quarter and a loud crash from the hills. This passage indicates that the Fish Gate was a significant location within the city and that its destruction would be a sign of God's judgment. ¶The rebuilding of the Fish Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile.

The battle spread out over the countryside, and the forest claimed more lives than the sword (2 Samuel 18:8). David's men defeated Absalom's army, and Absalom himself was killed when his hair got caught in the branches of a tree, and Joab thrust three javelins into his heart (2 Samuel 18:9-15). ¶The exact location of the Forest of Ephraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been situated east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead, where the tribe of Ephraim had some land allotted to them (Joshua 17:15-18). Others suggest that it could have been a forested area within the territory of Ephraim, west of the Jordan. ¶The significance of the Forest of Ephraim lies in its role as the setting for the decisive battle that ended Absalom's rebellion and restored David to the throne.

As Paul approached the city, believers from Rome traveled to meet him at two locations: the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns (Acts 28:15). ¶The Forum of Appius was situated about 43 miles (69 kilometers) southeast of Rome and was a popular stopping point for travelers. It was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who initiated the construction of the Appian Way in 312 BC. The town likely served as a marketplace and resting place for those journeying along the road. ¶The fact that Christians from Rome came to meet Paul at the Forum of Appius demonstrates the strong support and eagerness of the Roman believers to welcome and encourage the apostle. This meeting would have provided Paul with much-needed fellowship and reassurance as he faced the challenges of his impending trial before Caesar. ¶The mention of the Forum of Appius in the biblical account of Paul's journey to Rome provides insight into the spread of Christianity and the connections between believers in different parts of the Roman Empire.

The procession, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, started at the Fountain Gate and proceeded to the Water Gate, then to the Sheep Gate, and finally to the Temple. ¶The name \"Fountain Gate\" suggests that it may have been located near a water source, possibly the Gihon Spring or the Pool of Siloam, which were important for Jerusalem's water supply. Its proximity to the King's Garden also indicates that it was in an area of the city associated with royalty and agriculture. ¶The rebuilding of the Fountain Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of Shallun in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different individuals and groups.",

        "ext_description": "Gaash is mentioned in the Bible as a mountain or hill located in the tribal territory of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. It is most notably associated with Joshua, the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites during the conquest of the Promised Land. ¶According to Joshua 24:30 and Judges 2:9, after Joshua had led the Israelites into Canaan and divided the land among the tribes, he died at the age of 110 and was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. ¶The specific location of Mount Gaash is not clearly identified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated in the vicinity of Timnath-serah, which is thought to be modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, located approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Shechem. ¶In addition to being the burial place of Joshua, Mount Gaash is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men. In 2 Samuel 23:30 and 1 Chronicles 11:32, Hiddai (or Hurai) of the brooks of Gaash is listed among the elite warriors who fought alongside David. This suggests that the region around Mount Gaash was known for its brave and skilled fighters. ¶The mention of Mount Gaash in the Bible serves to underscore the importance of Joshua as a key figure in Israel's history and his significant role in leading the people into the Promised Land. The association of this location with Joshua's burial place and the homeland of some of David's mighty men highlights the enduring legacy of faith and courage that these individuals embodied.",

        "ext_description": "Gabbatha, also known as the Stone Pavement, is mentioned in John 19:13 as the location where Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, sat in judgment over Jesus during his trial. The Gospel of John provides this detail as part of the narrative of Jesus' passion and crucifixion. ¶According to John's account, after Pilate had questioned Jesus and found no guilt in him, he brought Jesus out to the Jews and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called \"The Stone Pavement,\" which in Aramaic is \"Gabbatha.\" This event took place around the sixth hour on the day of Preparation for the Passover. ¶The term \"Gabbatha\" is an Aramaic word that means \"elevated place\" or \"platform.\" The Stone Pavement, or Lithostrotos in Greek, refers to a raised, paved area, possibly adorned with mosaic or stone tiles. This platform was likely located in the open courtyard of Herod's palace in Jerusalem, where the Roman governor would conduct official business and pronounce judgments. ¶The mention of Gabbatha in the context of Jesus' trial highlights the political and judicial aspects of the proceedings. Pilate, as the Roman governor, represented the authority of the Roman Empire, and his seating on the judgment seat at Gabbatha underscores the official nature of the trial and the verdict he would render. ¶The specific location of Gabbatha within Jerusalem is not conclusively known, but it is believed to have been near the present-day Antonia Fortress, north of the Temple Mount. Archaeological excavations in the area have uncovered remains of a large, paved courtyard that may have been the Stone Pavement mentioned in the Gospel of John. ¶The reference to Gabbatha in the Bible provides a vivid detail of the setting of Jesus' trial and the events leading up to his crucifixion. It also offers insight into the political and judicial realities of the time, as well as the significance of the location where the momentous decision regarding Jesus' fate was made.",

        "ext_description": "Galilee is a region located in northern Israel, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to the east, and the Jezreel Valley to the south. In the Old Testament, Galilee is mentioned as part of the tribal allotments of Naphtali (Joshua 20:7) and Zebulun (Joshua 21:32), and as a region that Solomon gave to Hiram, king of Tyre (1 Kings 9:11). ¶In the New Testament, Galilee plays a significant role in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a town in Galilee (Luke 2:39), and began his public ministry in the region after being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9). Many of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were from Galilee (Acts 1:11). ¶Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is recorded as traveling and teaching extensively in Galilee, performing miracles and drawing large crowds (Matthew 4:23-25; Mark 1:28, 39; Luke 4:14, 44). Notable events in Galilee include the wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11), the healing of the centurion's servant (Luke 7:1-10), and the feeding of the five thousand (Luke 9:10-17). ¶Galilee was also the location of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to his disciples (Matthew 28:7, 10, 16; John 21:1-14). After Jesus' ascension, the early church spread throughout Galilee, Judea, and Samaria (Acts 9:31). ¶In addition to its religious significance, Galilee was known for its agricultural fertility and was an important center of trade and commerce. The region was inhabited by a mix of Jews and Gentiles, and was known for its distinct accent and dialect (Matthew 26:69; Mark 14:70; Luke 22:59). ¶The Bible also mentions several political and social events connected to Galilee, such as the census during the time of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:1-4), the rule of Herod Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee (Luke 3:1), and the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices (Luke 13:1-2).",

This event occurred during the time when David was fleeing from Saul's pursuit and Saul had given Michal to Paltiel as a political move to strengthen his own position. ¶Later, in Isaiah 10:30, Gallim is mentioned in a prophetic passage describing the advance of the Assyrian army toward Jerusalem. In this context, the town is personified as a daughter who is called to cry out, along with other nearby towns, in the face of the impending invasion. ¶The exact location of Gallim is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly near the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.

In this passage, Ezekiel describes the wealth, splendor, and trade relationships of Tyre, portraying it as a prosperous and well-defended city. ¶Among the various peoples and nations listed as contributing to Tyre's defense and commerce, the Gamad are specifically mentioned as being \"in your towers.\" This suggests that they served as guards or watchmen on the city's fortifications, helping to protect Tyre from potential threats. ¶The exact identity and origin of the Gamad are not provided in the biblical text, and there is limited historical or archaeological information about them outside of this single reference. Some scholars propose that they may have been a tribe or clan from the region around Tyre, possibly of Phoenician or Syrian origin, but this remains uncertain. ¶The mention of the Gamad in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to underscore the extensive network of alliances and trade relationships that Tyre had established, as well as the city's formidable defenses. However, despite the presence of the Gamad and other defenders, Ezekiel's prophecy ultimately foretells the downfall and destruction of Tyre at the hands of its enemies.",

This expansion of the city's limits symbolizes the growth and prosperity that will characterize Jerusalem during the time of its restoration. ¶Although the hill of Gareb is only mentioned briefly in the Bible, its inclusion in Jeremiah's prophecy highlights the significance of Jerusalem's future restoration and the importance of its expanded boundaries.",

The city is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Gath was one of the last strongholds of the Anakim, a race of giants (Joshua 11:22). The city gained prominence as the hometown of Goliath, the giant warrior who was defeated by David in single combat (1 Samuel 17:4, 23). ¶Gath played a significant role in the life of David. When fleeing from King Saul, David sought refuge in Gath, where he pretended to be insane to avoid arousing suspicion (1 Samuel 21:10-15). Later, David returned to Gath and served under King Achish, who gave him the town of Ziklag (1 Samuel 27:2-6). ¶The city was captured by David during his reign as king (1 Chronicles 18:1), and it was also attacked by later Israelite kings, such as Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6) and Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:8). The term \"Gittite\" is used to refer to people from Gath, such as Obed-Edom, in whose house the Ark of the Covenant was temporarily kept (2 Samuel 6:10-11). ¶Gath is also mentioned in prophetic texts, such as Amos 6:2 and Micah 1:10, which speak of the city's destruction and the fate of its inhabitants. The exact location of Gath is uncertain, but it is believed to be Tell es-Safi, an archaeological site in modern-day Israel.",

This apparent discrepancy may be due to textual errors or could indicate that there were two cities named Gath-rimmon, one in Dan and another in Manasseh. ¶The Levites, who were not given a specific territorial inheritance like the other tribes, were distributed among the various tribes to serve as priests, teachers, and judges.

Located in the southwestern coastal plain of Canaan, Gaza was situated near the border with Egypt and served as an important trade center. ¶The city is first mentioned in Genesis 10:19 as part of the description of the Canaanite territories. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua defeated the king of Gaza (Joshua 10:41), but the city remained under Philistine control (Joshua 11:22). ¶Gaza is perhaps best known for its association with Samson, the Israelite judge with extraordinary strength. Samson visited Gaza and fell in love with a Philistine woman named Delilah (Judges 16:1). Later, after being betrayed by Delilah and captured by the Philistines, Samson was imprisoned in Gaza and ultimately brought down the temple of Dagon, killing himself and many Philistines (Judges 16:21-30). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Gaza is mentioned in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines (Judges 6:4; 1 Samuel 6:17) and as a target of prophetic judgment (Jeremiah 47:5; Amos 1:6-7; Zephaniah 2:4; Zechariah 9:5). ¶In the New Testament, Gaza is mentioned in Acts 8:26, where an angel directs Philip the evangelist to travel on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza. Along this road, Philip encounters an Ethiopian eunuch and shares the gospel with him, leading to the eunuch's conversion and baptism. ¶The name Gaza is believed to be derived from the Hebrew root meaning \"to be strong\" or \"to be fierce,\" possibly reflecting the city's reputation as a well-fortified and powerful center. The name Ayyah, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 7:28, is thought to be an alternate name for Gaza or a nearby town.",

Later, during the reign of King Asa of Judah, Geba was fortified using materials from Ramah, which Asa had destroyed (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). ¶After the Babylonian exile, Geba was one of the cities resettled by the returning Israelites (Ezra 2:26; Nehemiah 7:30). It was also mentioned as a city inhabited by the Levites and singers (Nehemiah 11:31; 12:29). ¶The prophet Isaiah mentions Geba in a prophecy concerning the advance of the Assyrian army towards Jerusalem (Isaiah 10:29). In a future prophecy, Zechariah declares that the land will be inhabited from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, indicating the extent of the restored land (Zechariah 14:10). ¶Geba's location on the northern border of Judah made it a strategically important city throughout Israel's history, serving as a defensive outpost and a Levitical city.",

The \"elders\" and \"wise men\" of Gebal are specifically mentioned as being employed on Tyrian ships. ¶Gebal is also listed in Psalm 83:7 among the nations that formed a coalition against Israel, along with Edom, Moab, and others. This suggests that Gebal, at times, was hostile towards Israel and aligned with its enemies. ¶However, in 1 Kings 5:18, the Gebalites (people of Gebal) are mentioned alongside the Sidonians as skilled stonecutters who helped prepare the stones for the construction of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. This indicates that Gebal also had a role in providing materials and labor for this important project. ¶The city of Gebal has a long history, with evidence of occupation dating back to the Bronze Age. It was an important center of trade and religion, particularly associated with the worship of the goddess Baalat Gebal. The city's strategic location and its valuable resources, such as cedar wood and skilled artisans, made it a significant player in the region's political and economic landscape.",

This Gedor is likely a different location from the town of Gedor mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. ¶According to the text, the Simeonites, faced with a shortage of pasture for their growing herds, traveled to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, in search of suitable grazing land. They found rich and good pasture there, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful, as some of the descendants of Ham had previously settled there. ¶The Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, attacked and defeated the Hamites and Meunites who inhabited the region, destroying them completely. They then settled in the area themselves, as it provided ample pasture for their flocks. ¶This event took place during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which suggests that it occurred sometime between 715 and 686 BC. The Simeonites' search for new pasture lands reflects the challenges faced by pastoral communities in ancient Israel and their willingness to migrate and engage in conflict to secure resources for their livestock. ¶The specific location of this Gedor is uncertain, but it is described as being to the east of a valley and having been previously inhabited by descendants of Ham, suggesting that it may have been situated in the Negev region or beyond, possibly in the direction of Edom or Sinai.",

The king of Geder is listed among the thirty-one kings who were conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. ¶The exact location of Gedor is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the hill country of Judah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated southwest of Jerusalem, possibly near the modern-day village of Khirbet Jedur.",

It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels in connection with several events in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. ¶In Matthew 14:34 and Mark 6:53, Gennesaret is described as the place where Jesus and his disciples landed after crossing the Sea of Galilee, following the miraculous feeding of the five thousand and Jesus walking on water. Upon landing, the people of the region recognized Jesus and brought the sick to him to be healed. ¶Luke 5:1 mentions the Lake of Gennesaret as the location where Jesus taught the crowds from Simon Peter's boat and performed the miraculous catch of fish, leading to the calling of Peter, James, and John as his disciples. ¶The Plain of Gennesaret is known for its fertile soil and mild climate, which allow for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In ancient times, the region was famous for its wheat, barley, melons, figs, and other fruits. The area was also known for its fishing industry, as the Sea of Galilee was rich in fish. ¶The exact extent of the Plain of Gennesaret is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally believed to have stretched from the town of Capernaum in the north to the town of Magdala in the south, covering an area of approximately 3 miles long and 1 mile wide (5 km by 1.6 km). ¶The region's fertility and its proximity to the Sea of Galilee made it an important agricultural and economic center in ancient times. The mention of Gennesaret in the Gospels highlights the significance of the area in the context of Jesus' ministry and the impact of his teachings and miracles on the local population.",

        "ext_description": "Gerasa (or Gadara) is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels as the region where Jesus performed a notable miracle, healing a man (or two men, according to Matthew) who was possessed by demons. The accounts of this event are found in Mark 5:1, Luke 8:26-37, and Matthew 8:28-34. ¶According to the Gospel narratives, after crossing the Sea of Galilee, Jesus and his disciples arrived in the region of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes). There, they encountered a man (or two men) who was possessed by demons and lived among the tombs. The demon-possessed man was extremely violent and could not be restrained, even with chains. ¶When Jesus commanded the demons to come out of the man, they begged him to send them into a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus granted their request, and the demons entered the pigs, causing the herd to rush down a steep bank into the Sea of Galilee and drown. The man (or men) was then found sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind. ¶The exact location of this event is somewhat uncertain, as there are textual variations in the Gospels regarding the name of the place. Some manuscripts mention the region of the Gerasenes, while others refer to the Gadarenes. Gerasa (modern-day Jerash) was a city located about 37 miles (60 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee, while Gadara (modern-day Umm Qais) was a city located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee. The discrepancy in the location has led to various explanations: ¶1) The region of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes may have extended to the Sea of Galilee, even though the cities were some distance away. The \"country of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes\" could refer to a wider area around these cities. ¶2) There may have been a small town called Gergesa or Gersa near the Sea of Galilee, which was part of the larger region of the Gerasenes or Gadarenes. Some ancient manuscripts mention the \"Gergesenes,\" possibly referring to this town. ¶3) The gospel writers may have used the names of the larger, more well-known cities to help their readers understand the general location, even if the exact site was closer to the Sea of Galilee. ¶4) Matthew, writing primarily to a Jewish audience, may have used \"Gadarenes\" because Gadara was a prominent city in the region, while Mark and Luke, writing to Gentile audiences, used \"Gerasenes\" as Gerasa was an important Gentile city. ¶Despite the variations in the place names, the gospel accounts agree that the healing of the demoniac took place on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in a predominantly Gentile region. The presence of pigs, considered unclean by Jews, further confirms the Gentile character of the area.",

It is mentioned in the Bible as a place of significant events and religious importance. ¶In Deuteronomy 11:29 and 27:12, Moses instructed the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land, they were to pronounce blessings from Mount Gerizim and curses from Mount Ebal. This event took place under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in Joshua 8:33, where half of the tribes stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as the blessings and curses were read aloud. ¶Mount Gerizim is also associated with the parable of Jotham, son of Gideon, as recorded in Judges 9:7. After his brother Abimelech killed their seventy brothers and was made king by the men of Shechem, Jotham stood on top of Mount Gerizim and told a parable about the trees anointing a king over themselves. The parable was a warning against Abimelech's treachery and the folly of the men of Shechem in supporting him. ¶In later history, Mount Gerizim became a sacred site for the Samaritans, who built a temple there in the 5th century BC. They believed that Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem, was the chosen place for worship. This led to tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews, as evident in the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:20-21). ¶Today, Mount Gerizim, along with Mount Ebal, continues to be an important religious and archaeological site, with ruins of the Samaritan temple and other ancient structures still visible.",

Fearing retaliation from the Babylonians for Gedaliah's murder, Johanan and his group, along with the rescued captives, sought refuge in Geruth Chimham, which was near Bethlehem. ¶The name \"Geruth Chimham\" suggests that it was a lodging place or caravanserai associated with someone named Chimham.

David, in return, offered to care for Chimham and allow him to return to Jerusalem with him. ¶If this connection is accurate, it is possible that David granted Chimham a piece of land near Bethlehem, where he established a lodging place for travelers. This would explain why Johanan and his group sought refuge there, as it was a known and established location. ¶The mention of Geruth Chimham in Jeremiah 41:17 highlights the chaos and fear that followed the Babylonian conquest and the murder of Gedaliah, as well as the desperate measures taken by those seeking to escape potential retribution.

It bordered the Israelite territories of Manasseh and Maacah, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:14 and Joshua 12:5; 13:11. ¶The kingdom of Geshur played a significant role in the life of King David and his family. David married Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (2 Samuel 3:3; 1 Chronicles 3:2). Maacah was the mother of Absalom and Tamar, two of David's children who were involved in a tragic family conflict. ¶After Absalom murdered his half-brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of his sister Tamar, he fled to Geshur and sought refuge with his grandfather, King Talmai (2 Samuel 13:37-38). Absalom remained in Geshur for three years before Joab, David's commander, arranged for his return to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 14:23,32). ¶Later, when Absalom rebelled against his father David, he went to Geshur to gather support and raise an army (2 Samuel 15:8). This suggests that Absalom maintained ties with his maternal grandfather's kingdom and used it as a base for his political ambitions. ¶In Joshua 13:13, it is mentioned that the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites, indicating that they coexisted with the Aramean kingdom. However, during the reign of Solomon, it seems that Geshur came under Israelite control, as 1 Chronicles 2:23 mentions that Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took Geshur and Aram and their towns. ¶The biblical narrative portrays Geshur as an independent Aramean kingdom that had close ties with the Israelite royal family through marriage alliances. Its location and political significance made it a place of refuge and a potential source of support for those involved in the power struggles within the Israelite monarchy.",

It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels as the place where Jesus went to pray and was later arrested before his crucifixion. ¶The name \"Gethsemane\" is derived from the Aramaic words \"gat shemanim,\" meaning \"oil press,\" suggesting that the garden may have contained an olive press or was located in an area known for olive oil production. ¶According to Matthew 26:36 and Mark 14:32, after the Last Supper, Jesus went with his disciples to Gethsemane. He took Peter, James, and John with him and asked them to stay awake and pray while he went further into the garden to pray alone. In his agony, Jesus prayed, \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will\" (Matthew 26:39). ¶During his prayer, Jesus was deeply distressed and sorrowful, to the point of sweating drops of blood (Luke 22:44). This intense emotional and spiritual struggle underscores the significance of Gethsemane as the place where Jesus fully embraced his impending suffering and death. After his prayer, Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot and arrested.",

David also defeated the Philistines from Geba to Gezer (2 Samuel 5:25; 1 Chronicles 14:16).

Abner, the commander of Ishbosheth's army, was retreating after being defeated. Joab and Abishai, David's generals and brothers, pursued Abner and his men. ¶The text states that the pursuit continued \"on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon\" and that \"the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon\" (2 Samuel 2:24, ESV). ¶No further details are provided about Giah. It seems to have been a known landmark on the road from Gibeon toward the wilderness area to the east.

It was inhabited by Hivites, a Canaanite people group. ¶When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, the Gibeonites tricked them into making a peace treaty by pretending to be from a distant land (Joshua 9:3-15). Despite the deception, Joshua honored the treaty when the truth was discovered. ¶Gibeon's importance is underscored by the fact that its king, Hoham, led a coalition of five Amorite kings against Israel (Joshua 10:1-5). In response, Joshua asked God for the sun to stand still during the ensuing battle, allowing Israel to defeat the coalition (Joshua 10:12-14). ¶After the conquest, Gibeon was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin and designated as a Levitical city (Joshua 18:25, 21:17). The tabernacle was set up at Gibeon for a period, and it became a major worship center (1 Chronicles 16:39, 21:29).",

However, the Israelites set an ambush and lured the Benjamites away from Gibeah. As the Benjamites were retreating, they were pursued by the Israelites on the road to Gidom (Judges 20:45). The Israelites overtook the Benjamites and defeated them, striking down many of them. The reference to Gidom suggests that it was a known location near Gibeah, possibly on the route of the Benjamites' retreat.

It was at the Gihon spring that Solomon was anointed as king by the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan (1 Kings 1:33, 38, 45). King Hezekiah later directed the waters of the Gihon spring through a tunnel to the west side of the City of David, ensuring a reliable water supply for Jerusalem during times of siege (2 Chronicles 32:30). King Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, built a wall outside the City of David, extending it to the west of the Gihon spring (2 Chronicles 33:14).

In the ensuing battle, the Philistines fought fiercely against Israel, and Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 31:1-6). After the battle, the Philistines found the bodies of Saul and his sons and fastened them to the wall of Beth-shan (1 Samuel 31:10). Later, valiant men from Jabesh-gilead retrieved the bodies and buried them (1 Samuel 31:11-13; 2 Samuel 21:12). In his lament for Saul and Jonathan, David cursed the mountains of Gilboa, expressing his grief over their deaths (2 Samuel 1:21). The events at Mount Gilboa marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David to become king over Israel.

This Gilgal seems to have been a location where a community of prophets lived and trained, possibly different from the Gilgal mentioned in the books of Joshua and Samuel.

The Passover was also celebrated at Gilgal (Joshua 5:10).

Later, it became a place where the Israelites assembled and where Saul was confirmed as king (1 Samuel 11:14-15). Samuel included Gilgal in his circuit as a judge (1 Samuel 7:16). However, Gilgal also became associated with idolatrous worship, as evidenced by the prophets' condemnations (Hosea 4:15; 9:15; 12:11; Amos 4:4; 5:5).

The flight of the Beerothites to Gittaim suggests that the town was a place of refuge, possibly located outside Israelite territory. ¶The second reference to Gittaim is in Nehemiah 11:33, which lists the towns inhabited by the Benjamites after their return from Babylonian exile. Gittaim is mentioned along with other towns in the region, indicating that it was resettled by the Benjamites during the post-exilic period. ¶The exact location of Gittaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in Benjamite territory, north of Jerusalem.

In Ezekiel, Gog is described as the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, lands associated with the regions of Asia Minor (Ezekiel 38:2, 3). Gog is portrayed as a powerful enemy who will lead a coalition of nations in an attack against Israel in the latter days (Ezekiel 38:14-16). However, God will intervene and defeat Gog and his armies, demonstrating His power and sovereignty (Ezekiel 38:18-23; 39:1-6). The prophecy also mentions that Gog's forces will be buried in a place called the Valley of Hamon-gog, and the land will be cleansed (Ezekiel 39:11-16). In the book of Revelation, Gog and Magog are mentioned together, representing the nations that will be deceived by Satan and gather for battle against God's people at the end of the millennial reign (Revelation 20:8). The names Gog and Magog are symbolic, representing the final enemies of God's kingdom who will be ultimately defeated. The prophecies concerning Gog emphasize God's sovereignty, the certainty of His judgment against His enemies, and the ultimate victory of His people.",

Golan was also allotted to the Levites of the family of Gershon, along with other cities in the region, as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This allocation of cities to the Levites ensured that they would be dispersed throughout the land and could carry out their priestly duties among the various tribes of Israel. The region surrounding Golan became known as the territory of Golan or Gaulonitis.

The Gospel accounts describe how Jesus, after being sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, was led to Golgotha, where he was crucified along with two criminals. The location of Golgotha was outside the city walls, as was customary for executions in ancient times. It is also mentioned that the site was near a garden and a tomb, which belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, where Jesus' body was later laid (John 19:41-42). The crucifixion at Golgotha is the central event in the Christian faith, as it represents Jesus' sacrificial death for the sins of humanity, leading to his resurrection and the offer of salvation to all who believe in him.",

The Great Sea played a significant role in the history and geography of the region, with many important cities and ports located along its coast. The Philistines, who were a major enemy of the Israelites, occupied the coastal plain along the Great Sea (Joshua 9:1; 15:47). In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, the Great Sea is mentioned in the context of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:10, 15, 19; 48:28).

The prophet Zechariah speaks of Judah being like a bow and Ephraim like an arrow against Greece (Zechariah 9:13). Greece is also listed among the nations to which God will send survivors to proclaim His glory (Isaiah 66:19). In Ezekiel's prophecy, Javan is mentioned as a trading partner of Tyre, providing slaves and bronze vessels (Ezekiel 27:13,19). ¶In the New Testament, Greece is mentioned as a region visited by Paul during his missionary journeys (Acts 20:2). The term \"Hellenist\" is used to describe Greek-speaking Jews who had adopted Greek culture (Acts 6:1; 9:29; 11:20).

It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Nehemiah 12:39, during the description of the dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. ¶During this dedication, Nehemiah divided the leaders of Judah into two large choirs. One choir proceeded on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate (Nehemiah 12:31). The second choir, which included Nehemiah, went to the left. They marched on the wall past several gates and towers, including the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, and the Sheep Gate, until they stopped at the Guard Gate (Nehemiah 12:38-39). ¶Based on its location in the description of the procession, the Guard Gate appears to have been situated on the eastern side of the city, near the Temple area. Many scholars believe it to be the same gate as the Muster Gate or Inspection Gate, mentioned in Nehemiah 3:31 as being near the Temple. ¶The exact purpose of this gate is not specified in the biblical text. Its name suggests it may have been a point where guards were stationed or where prisoners were kept, but this is not stated explicitly. It could also possibly refer to a place where people or goods were inspected before entering the city or Temple precincts. ¶Apart from this single reference in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about the Guard Gate in the Bible. Its mention in the context of the wall's dedication ceremony highlights its significance as part of Jerusalem's fortifications during the post-exilic period.",

Its exact location is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Rummaneh, a village in the Jezreel Valley about 6 miles south of Megiddo. ¶Zechariah's prophecy uses this historic event as a metaphor for the intense mourning that will take place when God pours out a spirit of grace and supplication on Jerusalem, causing them to look on the one they have pierced and mourn bitterly (Zechariah 12:10). The comparison emphasizes the depth and sincerity of the people's repentance.",

This event is also described in 2 Kings 18:11, emphasizing that the Israelites were deported because they had sinned against the Lord. ¶The third reference to Halah is in 1 Chronicles 5:26, which states that the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser III) and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, who took the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile, bringing them to Halah and other locations. ¶The exact location of Halah is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been in the region of the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia (modern-day Syria or Iraq). This area was under Assyrian control during the time of the Israelite exile. ¶The Bible does not provide any further information about Halah or the lives of the exiled Israelites there.

As the king of Israel, Solomon's throne represented his authority and his role as the supreme judge in the land. The Hall of the Throne, therefore, served as the official space where Solomon exercised his judicial responsibilities and made decisions that impacted the lives of his subjects. The use of cedar paneling in the hall added to its grandeur and significance, reflecting the importance of the king's role and the solemnity of the proceedings that took place there. Beyond this brief mention in the description of Solomon's palace, no further details are provided about specific events or judgments that occurred in the Hall of the Throne.",

During this conflict, Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allied kings waged war against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and other cities in the region. In the course of their campaign, Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated several groups, including the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim (Genesis 14:5). The Zuzim, who were defeated in Ham, are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and little is known about them. Ham's exact location is also uncertain, as it is not referenced in any other biblical passages or extra-biblical sources. Its mention in the context of the war of the kings suggests that it was a place of some significance during the time of Abraham, but no further details about its history, size, or role in the region are provided. The defeat of the Zuzim in Ham by Chedorlaomer and his allies highlights the power and influence of these foreign kings in the region during this period. ",

The city was known for its military strength and strategic importance, as evidenced by its mentions in the context of conflicts and conquests (2 Kings 14:28; 17:24, 30; 18:34; 19:13; Isaiah 10:9; 36:19; 37:13; Jeremiah 39:5; 49:23; 52:9, 27). ¶During the reigns of various Israelite kings, Hamath served as a marker of the extent of their dominion. Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (2 Kings 14:25). Solomon, known for his expansive kingdom, is described as having ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt, including Tiphsah and Gaza (1 Kings 4:21, 24). ¶The Assyrians conquered Hamath in the 8th century BC and deported some of its inhabitants to Samaria (2 Kings 17:24, 30). The fall of Hamath is mentioned in the prophetic oracles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, often in the context of judgment against the city for its pride and wickedness (Isaiah 10:9; Jeremiah 49:23; Amos 6:2). ¶In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, Hamath is mentioned as one of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:15-17, 20; 48:1), indicating its continued significance as a geographical marker. ¶The exact location of Hamath is believed to be near the modern-day city of Hama in western Syria, situated along the Orontes River. Its strategic location along trade routes and its proximity to Israel made it a city of great importance in the ancient Near East.",

The town's name, Hannathon, is of Hebrew origin and means \"favored\" or \"gracious.\" ¶Apart from its mention in the delineation of Zebulun's territory, no further information about Hannathon is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The tribe of Zebulun, along with the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali, occupied the fertile lands of the Galilee region. They were known for their agricultural and commercial activities, benefiting from the region's rich soil and proximity to trade routes.",

Later, when Jacob fled from his brother Esau, he sought refuge in Haran with his uncle Laban (Genesis 27:43; 28:10). Jacob lived in Haran for many years, marrying Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel, and working for Laban (Genesis 29:4). Haran was known for its association with the worship of the moon god, Sin. In the Old Testament, Haran is mentioned as one of the places conquered by the Assyrian kings (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12) and as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23).

The context of the passage suggests that Harmon is a place of punishment and humiliation for the proud and oppressive women of Samaria, who would be driven out of their city and cast into a foreign land.

This event demonstrated God's power to deliver Israel from their enemies, even with a small force. The exact location of the Spring of Harod is not certain, but it is believed to be in the Jezreel Valley, near the ancient city of Jezreel.

The name \"Hazeroth\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"hatser,\" meaning \"enclosure\" or \"court,\" suggesting that the site may have had some form of semi-permanent structures. At Hazeroth, Moses faced challenges to his leadership from his siblings, Aaron and Miriam (Num 12). God affirmed Moses' unique role as His chosen leader and judged Miriam with temporary leprosy. The Israelites remained at Hazeroth for an unspecified period before setting out into the wilderness of Paran (Num 12:16). The exact location of Hazeroth is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Sinai Peninsula, between Mount Sinai and Kadesh-barnea.",

It is first mentioned in Genesis 13:18, where Abraham pitched his tent and built an altar to the Lord. The city was originally named Kiriath-arba, which means \"the city of Arba,\" who was the greatest man among the Anakim (Joshua 14:15). ¶Hebron played a significant role in the lives of the patriarchs. Sarah, Abraham's wife, died in Kiriath-arba, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for her (Genesis 23:2, 19). Later, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were also buried there (Genesis 35:27; 49:29-32). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Hebron was taken by Joshua and the Israelites (Joshua 10:36-37). The city was given to Caleb as his inheritance (Joshua 14:13-14), and later became a city of the Levites and a city of refuge (Joshua 20:7; 21:11-13). ¶Hebron served as the capital of Judah during the reign of David. He was anointed king over the house of Judah in Hebron and reigned there for seven and a half years (2 Samuel 2:1-4, 11; 5:5). Several of David's sons were born in Hebron, including Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah (2 Samuel 3:2-5). ¶The city remained significant throughout Israel's history. It was fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:10) and was inhabited by Jews after the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). ¶Hebron is also notable for its association with the Anakim, a group of giants who inhabited the area (Numbers 13:22, 33). Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai (Joshua 15:13-14; Judges 1:10, 20). ¶Today, Hebron is still an important city, known for the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is believed to be the burial site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The city has a rich history and holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.",

The exact meaning and identity of Helech is uncertain, and Bible scholars have proposed different interpretations. ¶One view is that Helech refers to a place, possibly the Assyrian name for the region of Cilicia, located north of the Taurus Mountains. The Cilicians were known for their warlike character and could have served as mercenaries in the army of Tyre, which would fit the context of Ezekiel's prophecy. ¶Another interpretation is that Helech is not a place name but rather a Hebrew term derived from the root word חיל (ḥayil), meaning \"strength\" or \"army.\" In this case, the final letter of Helech would be understood as a feminine form of the pronoun \"you,\" referring to the city of Tyre. This interpretation is supported by the King James Version and the American Standard Version, which translate Helech as \"thine army.\" ¶The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, seems to favor the interpretation of Helech as a term for Tyre's army rather than a place name. ¶Given the limited information provided in the single biblical reference, the exact identity of Helech remains uncertain. The mention of Helech in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to emphasize the strength and military might of Tyre, which would ultimately be brought to ruin by God's judgment, as declared by the prophet Ezekiel.",

The Sidonians called the mountain Sirion, while the Amorites called it Senir (Deut 3:9; Ezek 27:5). Mount Hermon was known for its abundant dew (Ps 133:3) and was a source of refreshment for the surrounding lands (Jer 18:14). The mountain was also associated with the Canaanite god Baal, as evidenced by the names Baal-hermon, Baal-hamon, and Baal-gad (Judg 3:3; Song 8:11). Its majestic appearance is celebrated in the Psalms (Ps 29:6; 89:12), and it is mentioned as a place of beauty and fertility (Song 4:8).",

The exact location of Heshmon is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. ¶The name \"Heshmon\" is derived from the Hebrew root meaning \"fatness\" or \"fertility,\" which may suggest that the town was situated in a relatively fertile area within the Negev region, known for its arid climate. ¶The mention of Heshmon in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance.

After rescuing his nephew Lot, who had been taken captive by Chedorlaomer and his allies, Abraham chased them as far as Hobah. The exact location of Hobah is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the vicinity of modern-day Choba, about 60 miles north of Damascus. Some Jewish traditions identify Hobah with the village of Jobar, near Damascus, where there is a synagogue dedicated to Elijah. The name \"Hobah\" may be derived from the Hebrew word meaning \"hiding place\" or the Akkadian word meaning \"land of reeds.\"",

The town is also mentioned in the account of David's census (2 Samuel 24:6).

The people of Ivvah, along with those from other conquered cities, were later resettled in Samaria by the Assyrian king (2 Kings 17:24). These people, known as the Avvites, continued to worship their own gods in their new land (2 Kings 17:31). The exact location of Ivvah is unknown, but it was likely situated somewhere in Syria or Mesopotamia.",

The town is mentioned in prophecies concerning Moab (Isaiah 15:4; Jeremiah 48:21, 34), indicating its continued significance in the region. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the northern border of Moab.",

It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with archaeological evidence dating back to 9000 BC. In the Bible, Jericho is most famous as the first city conquered by the Israelites after they crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land (Joshua 2-6). The city's walls miraculously fell after the Israelites marched around it for seven days, allowing them to destroy the city. Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:21) and was later rebuilt during the time of Ahab (1 Kings 16:34). The city also played a role in several other biblical events, such as being the location where the Israelites camped before entering Canaan (Numbers 22:1; 26:3, 63), where Eglon, king of Moab, oppressed Israel (Judges 3:12-14), and where Zedekiah was captured by the Babylonians (Jeremiah 39:5; 52:8). In the New Testament, Jericho is mentioned as the place where Jesus healed blind Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46) and where he encountered Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10).",

It is mentioned hundreds of times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The city was originally known as Salem (Genesis 14:18; Psalm 76:2) and was later called Jebus, after the Jebusites who inhabited it (Judges 19:10; 1 Chronicles 11:4). David conquered the city and made it his capital (2 Samuel 5:6-9; 1 Chronicles 11:4-9). Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6-8; 2 Chronicles 3-7), which became the center of Jewish worship. The city was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10; 2 Chronicles 36:17-19) but was later rebuilt after the exile (Ezra 1:1-4; Nehemiah 2:11-20). In the New Testament, Jerusalem is the site of many events in the life of Jesus, including his triumphal entry (Matthew 21:1-11), cleansing of the temple (Matthew 21:12-17), and crucifixion (Matthew 27:32-56). The early church also began in Jerusalem (Acts 1-7). Throughout the Bible, Jerusalem is referred to by various names, each highlighting a different aspect of its significance: Ariel (Isaiah 29:1), My Delight Is in Her (Isaiah 62:4), Forsaken and Desolate (Isaiah 62:4), Married (Isaiah 62:4), the City of the Lord (Isaiah 60:14), Zion (Psalm 87:2), and Mount Zion (Psalm 48:1). The name \"Jerusalem\" itself may mean \"foundation of peace\" or \"possession of peace.\"",

The prophet Jonah set sail from Joppa when he tried to flee from God's command to preach in Nineveh (Jonah 1:3). In the New Testament, Joppa is significant as the place where Peter stayed with Simon the tanner and had a vision that led him to preach to the Gentiles (Acts 9:36-43; 10:5-23). It was also the home of Tabitha (Dorcas), whom Peter raised from the dead (Acts 9:36-42).

The Jordan River formed the eastern boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:12) and was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership when they entered Canaan (Joshua 3-4). The river also served as a boundary between the tribes settling east and west of the Jordan (Joshua 22:25). Several significant events took place along the Jordan, including the parting of the river for Elijah and Elisha (2 Kings 2:6-14), Naaman's healing (2 Kings 5:10-14), and John the Baptist's ministry of baptism (Matthew 3:5-6; Mark 1:5). The Jordan Valley was known for its fertile land, as seen in Lot's choice to settle there (Genesis 13:10-11). The region also served as a refuge for Elijah (1 Kings 17:3-5) and David (2 Samuel 17:22-24). In the New Testament, Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9) and conducted ministry in the region (Matthew 4:25; 19:1). The Jordan River and its surrounding area continue to hold great significance for Christians, Jews, and Muslims today.",

The area was named after the tribe of Judah, which settled there after the Israelites conquered Canaan. Judea was known for its hilly terrain and its capital, Jerusalem, which served as the religious and political center of the Jewish people. The region played a significant role throughout biblical history, from the time of the judges to the New Testament era. Many important events took place in Judea, including the reigns of King David and King Solomon, the construction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, and the ministries of Jesus and the early church. Judea was the birthplace of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5, 65) and Jesus (Matthew 2:1, 5). During the New Testament period, Judea was a Roman province, and it was the scene of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection (Luke 23:5; John 19:19-20). The early Christian church began in Jerusalem and spread throughout Judea (Acts 1:8; 2:9). The region's history, culture, and religious significance made it a central focus of both the Old and New Testaments.",

It was also the site where Miriam died and was buried (Numbers 20:1) and where Moses and Aaron disobeyed God by striking the rock to bring forth water (Numbers 20:10-13).

Jesus later healed a royal official's son from Capernaum while in Cana (John 4:46). Nathanael, one of Jesus' disciples, was also from Cana (John 21:2).

Joshua 13:19 confirms that Kiriathaim was allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of their inheritance. However, the city later appears to have reverted to Moabite control, as the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of God's judgment against Moab, specifically mentioning Kiriathaim (Jeremiah 48:1, 23; Ezekiel 25:9). The name \"Kiriathaim\" means \"double city\" or \"two cities,\" possibly indicating that it consisted of two parts or was a significant city in the region.

Later, Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, fortified Lachish as part of his defense strategy (2 Chronicles 11:9). During the reign of King Amaziah, Lachish served as a refuge for the king when he fled from a conspiracy in Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:19; 2 Chronicles 25:27). In the time of King Hezekiah, the Assyrian king Sennacherib captured Lachish and used it as a base to send his officials to threaten Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:14, 17; 19:8; 2 Chronicles 32:9; Isaiah 36:2; 37:8). The city was one of the last fortified cities in Judah to fall to the Babylonians during the reign of Zedekiah (Jeremiah 34:7). After the Babylonian exile, Lachish was resettled by the people of Judah (Nehemiah 11:30). The prophet Micah also mentioned Lachish, urging the city to give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath (Micah 1:13).",

The Laodicean church is rebuked for being lukewarm in their faith, neither hot nor cold, and for their self-sufficiency and spiritual complacency (Revelation 3:14-16). Despite their material wealth, Jesus declares them to be spiritually poor, blind, and naked, urging them to repent and seek true spiritual riches from Him (Revelation 3:17-18).",

Lebanon is described as part of the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 1:7; 11:24; Joshua 1:4) and was a region where some Canaanite inhabitants remained (Judges 3:3).

Paul later returned to Lystra to strengthen the disciples (Acts 14:21). Timothy, a young disciple who accompanied Paul on his missionary journeys, was from Lystra (Acts 16:1-2).",

Paul wrote epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians, which are included in the New Testament.

Jonathan, Saul's son, launched a daring attack on the Philistine garrison near Michmash, which led to a great victory for Israel (1 Samuel 14:5, 31). After the Babylonian exile, some people from Michmash returned to resettle in their hometown (Ezra 2:27; Nehemiah 7:31; 11:31). The prophet Isaiah mentions Michmash in his prophecy about the advance of the Assyrian army, indicating that it was on the route from the north to Jerusalem (Isaiah 10:28).",

The Midianites lived in the desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the area east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Moses fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian and married Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest (Exodus 2:15-22). Jethro later visited Moses and offered him wise counsel (Exodus 18:1-27). ¶During the time of the judges, the Midianites, along with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, oppressed Israel for seven years (Judges 6:1-6). God raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from the Midianites (Judges 6:11-24). Gideon, with a small army of 300 men, defeated the Midianites and their allies, who were \"as numerous as locusts\" (Judges 7-8). ¶The Midianites were involved in the incident at Peor, where Israelite men were enticed into sexual immorality and idolatry (Numbers 25:1-18). As a result, God commanded Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites (Numbers 25:17-18; 31:1-54). ¶In later biblical history, the Midianites are mentioned as traders who bought Joseph from his brothers and sold him into slavery in Egypt (Genesis 37:28, 36). The prophet Isaiah refers to the defeat of Midian as a symbol of God's power to deliver his people (Isaiah 9:4; 10:26). The Midianites are also mentioned in the genealogy of Edom (Genesis 36:35; 1 Chronicles 1:46) and in a psalm calling for God's judgment on Israel's enemies (Psalm 83:9).",

It was a significant port city and a center of trade and culture in the Greco-Roman world. ¶In the New Testament, Miletus is mentioned in connection with the Apostle Paul's missionary journeys. During his third journey, Paul stopped at Miletus on his way to Jerusalem and sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus to meet him there (Acts 20:15, 17). He delivered a farewell address to the Ephesian elders, warning them about false teachers and encouraging them to remain faithful to God (Acts 20:18-35). ¶In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Trophimus, one of his companions, ill at Miletus. This statement provides insight into the challenges and hardships faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled and spread the gospel message. ¶Miletus was known for its wool industry and its intellectual and artistic achievements. It was the birthplace of several notable Greek philosophers, including Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who were among the first to seek rational explanations for natural phenomena.",

The name \"Millo\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"millu',\" meaning \"filling\" or \"terrace,\" while \"Akra\" comes from the Greek word for \"citadel\" or \"stronghold.\" ¶King Solomon further strengthened and expanded Millo as part of his building projects in Jerusalem (1 Kings 9:15, 24). The construction of Millo was a significant undertaking, requiring a large workforce and resources (1 Kings 11:27). ¶During the reign of King Hezekiah, Millo was repaired and fortified as part of the preparations for the Assyrian invasion (2 Chronicles 32:5). The \"House of Millo\" is mentioned in connection with the coronation of King Joash (2 Kings 12:20), suggesting that it may have served as a royal residence or an important administrative center. ¶The exact location and nature of Millo are not clearly described in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been a terraced structure or a landfill that supported the fortifications and buildings in the City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem. Others suggest that it could have been a separate fortress or citadel within the city. Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem have uncovered remains of ancient fortifications and structures that may be associated with Millo, but the precise identification remains uncertain.",

Later, the prophet Samuel summoned the people to Mizpah for prayer, repentance, and deliverance from the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:5-7, 11-12, 16). Samuel also gathered the Israelites at Mizpah to appoint Saul as their first king (1 Samuel 10:17). ¶Mizpah was the hometown and burial place of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:19; 2:11; 7:17; 8:4; 15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23; 20:1; 25:1; 28:3). It was also the city of Joseph of Arimathea, the wealthy disciple who provided the tomb for Jesus' burial (Matthew 27:57; Mark 15:43; Luke 23:50-51; John 19:38). ¶During the divided monarchy, King Asa of Judah fortified Mizpah using materials from the dismantled fortifications of Ramah (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). After the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, Mizpah served as the administrative center for the remnant of Judah under Gedaliah (2 Kings 25:23, 25; Jeremiah 40:6, 8, 10, 12-13, 15; 41:1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 16).",

The Moabites worshipped the god Chemosh and induced some Israelites to join in their idolatrous sacrifices (Num. 25:1-2). ¶Throughout the time of the judges and early monarchy, the Moabites were in frequent conflict with Israel. King Saul fought against them (1 Sam. 14:47), and David subjugated them and made them tributaries (2 Sam. 8:2,12). After the division of the kingdom, the Moabites regained their independence. ¶During the reign of King Omri of Israel (c. 884-872 BC), who is mentioned in 1 Kings 16:23-28, Moabite lands were reconquered. However, about 40 years later, the Moabite king Mesha rebelled against Israel, as recorded on the famous Moabite Stone discovered in 1868 in Dibon (modern Dhiban, Jordan). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Amos all prophesied against Moab (Isa. 15-16, Jer. 48, Ezek. 25:8-11, Amos 2:1-2). After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Jews took refuge in Moab (Jer. 40:11). Moab disappears as a nation from the historical record sometime during the Persian period.",

        "ext_description": "Nazareth was a village in the region of Galilee, located about 15 miles west of the Sea of Galilee. It is best known as the hometown of Jesus Christ (Matt. 2:23; Luke 1:26; 2:39, 51; 4:16). Jesus was often referred to as \"Jesus of Nazareth\" or \"the Nazarene\" (Mark 1:24; 10:47; Luke 18:37; 24:19; John 18:5, 7; 19:19; Acts 2:22; 10:38). ¶Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament or in other ancient literature, suggesting it was a small, relatively insignificant village. The Gospels record that Jesus grew up in Nazareth, preached in its synagogue (Luke 4:16-30), and was initially rejected by its inhabitants (Matt. 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6; Luke 4:28-30). ¶In the first century, Nazareth had a negative reputation, as evidenced by Nathanael's question, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" (John 1:46). However, Jesus' upbringing in Nazareth fulfilled the prophecy that He would be called a Nazarene (Matt. 2:23), a term possibly derived from the Hebrew word \"netzer,\" meaning \"branch\" or \"shoot,\" and alluding to the Messiah (Isa. 11:1).",

In the story of Joseph, the Nile and its canals are the setting for Pharaoh's dreams about the seven years of plenty and seven years of famine (Gen. 41:1-3, 17-18). During the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, the Nile was the site of the miraculous plagues, such as the turning of the water into blood (Exod. 7:17-21) and the emergence of frogs from the river (Exod. 8:3-11). The Nile also played a role in the early life of Moses, who was placed in a basket among the reeds of the river as an infant (Exod. 2:3-5). ¶The prophets often used the Nile as a symbol of Egypt's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment (Isa. 19:6-8; Jer. 46:7-8; Ezek. 29:3-9; 30:12; Amos 8:8; 9:5; Nah. 3:8; Zech. 10:11). The Nile was also a source of economic prosperity for Egypt, as it provided water for irrigation and served as a major transportation route (Isa. 23:3, 10).",

It is first mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities founded by Nimrod, along with Rehoboth-Ir (Gen. 10:11-12). Nineveh became the capital of Assyria during the reign of Sennacherib (c. 705-681 BC) and was known for its size, power, and splendor (Jonah 3:3; 4:11). ¶In the book of Jonah, Nineveh is portrayed as a city of great wickedness, whose evil had come to God's attention (Jonah 1:2). Jonah was sent to preach against Nineveh, warning of its impending destruction. To Jonah's surprise, the people of Nineveh, from the king to the lowliest citizen, repented in response to his message (Jonah 3:5-9). As a result, God relented and spared the city (Jonah 3:10). ¶Despite this remarkable event, Nineveh remained a symbol of Assyrian power and a threat to Israel and Judah. The prophets Nahum and Zephaniah both foretold the eventual destruction of Nineveh as a judgment against Assyria's wickedness and oppression (Nah. 1:1; 2:8; 3:7; Zeph. 2:13). Nineveh fell to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 BC, marking the end of the Assyrian Empire. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the repentance of the Ninevites as a rebuke to his unbelieving generation (Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:30, 32).",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in relation to the life of Joseph. Joseph married Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On (Gen. 41:45, 50; 46:20). This marriage was arranged by Pharaoh and likely served to integrate Joseph into Egyptian society and religious life. ¶The city of On was a center of worship for the sun god Ra and was known for its temples and religious institutions. In the prophetic books, On is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against Egypt (Ezek. 30:17). Some translations and ancient versions (such as the Septuagint) also reference On in Isaiah 19:18, where it is called the \"City of Destruction\" or \"City of the Sun,\" depending on the interpretation of the Hebrew text.",

It was the homeland of Abraham's family, and the place where Isaac and Jacob found their wives (Gen. 25:20; 28:2, 5-7). The name \"Paddan-aram\" means \"the plain of Aram\" or \"the field of Aram,\" referring to the area's geographical characteristics and its association with the Arameans. ¶Rebekah, Isaac's wife, was from Paddan-aram (Gen. 25:20). Later, Jacob fled to Paddan-aram to escape his brother Esau's anger and to find a wife from among his relatives (Gen. 28:2, 5-7). During his time there, Jacob married Leah and Rachel and fathered eleven of his twelve sons (Gen. 35:23-26). Jacob eventually left Paddan-aram to return to Canaan with his family and possessions (Gen. 31:18; 33:18). ¶The Arameans, who inhabited Paddan-aram, are mentioned as the ancestors of the Israelites in the context of God's deliverance and blessing (Deut. 26:5). The prophet Hosea also refers to Jacob's flight to Paddan-aram and his service for a wife (Hos. 12:12).",

The proconsul, an intelligent man, summoned Paul and Barnabas and sought to hear the word of God. However, the sorcerer, also known as Elymas, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith (Acts 13:8). ¶Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked Elymas and temporarily blinded him, demonstrating the power of God (Acts 13:9-11). As a result, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord (Acts 13:12).

Historically, Pelusium served as a strategic frontier fortress and was known for its role in defending Egypt against foreign invasions. The city was also an important commercial center, situated at the crossroads of trade routes between Egypt, the Levant, and the Mediterranean world.

After the encounter, Jacob named the place Peniel, meaning \"face of God,\" saying, \"I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.\" The wrestling match marked a turning point in Jacob's life, as he received a new name, Israel, signifying his struggle with God and men (Gen. 32:28). ¶Later in the Bible, Penuel is mentioned as a city in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River. During the time of the judges, Gideon and his men pursued the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna to Penuel (Judg. 8:8-9). The men of Penuel refused to provide bread to Gideon's army, so Gideon vowed to tear down the tower of Penuel upon his return (Judg. 8:17). In the reign of King Jeroboam I of Israel, Penuel was one of the cities he fortified (1 Kgs. 12:25), possibly to secure his kingdom against the threat of Judah in the south.",

In the Bible, Persia is mentioned in the context of the Jewish exile and the subsequent return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Empire, which had destroyed Jerusalem and taken the Jews into captivity, fell to the Persians under Cyrus the Great (2 Chr. 36:20, 22-23; Ezra 1:1-2). Cyrus issued a decree allowing the exiled Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-4). The Persian kings Darius I and Artaxerxes I also played significant roles in supporting the rebuilding efforts (Ezra 4:24; 6:14). ¶The book of Esther is set in the Persian capital of Susa during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), and it describes how Esther, a Jewish woman, became queen and saved her people from a plot to destroy them (Esther 1:3, 14, 18; 10:2). The prophets Ezekiel and Daniel also mention Persia in their visions and prophecies (Ezek. 27:10; 38:5; Dan. 8:20; 10:1, 13, 20; 11:2). Persia is portrayed as a powerful empire that God used to fulfill His purposes for His people, even though the Persians themselves were not followers of the God of Israel.",

When the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, Balak sent messengers to Pethor to summon Balaam, offering him payment to curse Israel (Num. 22:5-7). Despite God's initial warning not to go with the men, Balaam eventually set out on his donkey to meet with Balak (Num. 22:21). Along the way, the Angel of the Lord opposed Balaam, and his donkey spoke to him, revealing the presence of the Angel (Num. 22:22-35). Balaam ultimately blessed Israel instead of cursing them, following God's command (Num. 23-24). The location of Pethor is not precisely known, but its association with the Euphrates River suggests that it was situated in the upper Mesopotamian region, possibly in the area of modern-day Syria or Iraq.",

Naaman was initially angry at this suggestion, exclaiming, \"Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?\" (2 Kgs. 5:12). However, after being persuaded by his servants, Naaman followed Elisha's instructions and was healed of his leprosy (2 Kgs. 5:13-14). The Pharpar River, which still exists today, flows from the Anti-Lebanon mountains and runs through the city of Damascus before emptying into a lake east of the city. Naaman's initial reluctance to wash in the Jordan highlights the pride and prejudice that can hinder people from experiencing God's healing and blessing.",

The city is first mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's second missionary journey (Acts 16:12). In Philippi, Paul and his companions met a group of women praying by the river, including Lydia, a merchant who became the first convert in Europe (Acts 16:13-15). However, Paul and Silas were soon imprisoned after casting out a spirit of divination from a slave girl (Acts 16:16-24). While in prison, they experienced a miraculous earthquake that led to the conversion of the jailer and his household (Acts 16:25-34). ¶Paul visited Philippi again on his third missionary journey (Acts 20:6) and later wrote a letter to the church, known as the Epistle to the Philippians. In this letter, Paul expresses his deep affection for the Philippian believers and thanks them for their support and partnership in the gospel (Phil. 1:3-7; 4:15-19). He also encourages them to remain united, humble, and joyful in the face of adversity (Phil. 1:27-2:18; 4:4-7). The church in Philippi is portrayed as a faithful and generous community, supporting Paul's ministry even in his imprisonment (Phil. 4:10-20).",

        "ext_description": "The Philistines were an ancient people who lived in the coastal plain of Canaan, primarily in the region known as Philistia, which corresponds to the modern-day Gaza Strip and the southern coast of Israel. They are first mentioned in the Bible during the time of Abraham (Gen. 21:32, 34) and Isaac (Gen. 26:1, 8, 14-15, 18). The Philistines were not part of the original inhabitants of Canaan and are believed to have migrated from the Aegean region, possibly as part of the Sea Peoples' movement in the 12th century BC. ¶Throughout the period of the judges and the early monarchy, the Philistines were a constant threat to the Israelites. They oppressed Israel for 40 years until Samson began to deliver them (Judg. 13:1, 5). Samson's encounters with the Philistines, including his marriage to a Philistine woman and his final act of bringing down the temple of Dagon, are recorded in Judges 14-16. During the time of Samuel, the Philistines defeated Israel and captured the Ark of the Covenant (1 Sam. 4). They were later forced to return the Ark after experiencing plagues (1 Sam. 5-6). ¶The Philistines continued to be a significant enemy during the reigns of Saul and David. The famous battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath took place during this time (1 Sam. 17). David fought against the Philistines throughout his reign (2 Sam. 5; 8:1, 12; 21; 23), and they remained a threat until the later years of the divided monarchy (2 Kgs. 18:8; 2 Chr. 26:6-7; 28:18). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Zephaniah all mention the Philistines in their oracles, often pronouncing judgment against them (Isa. 14:29-31; Jer. 47; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:8; Zeph. 2:5). ¶The Philistines were known for their advanced iron technology, their distinctive pottery, and their religious practices, which included the worship of deities such as Dagon, Ashtoreth, and Baal-Zebub. The biblical narrative portrays them as a formidable enemy of Israel, but also as a people whom God used to test and discipline His chosen nation.",

Later, when Paul and Barnabas were returning from the Jerusalem Council, they passed through Phoenicia, bringing joy to the believers there (Acts 15:3). During Paul's final journey to Jerusalem, he sailed to Tyre, a city in Phoenicia, where he stayed with disciples for seven days (Acts 21:2-4).

However, before they could reach Phoenix, a violent wind drove the ship off course, ultimately leading to its shipwreck on the island of Malta (Acts 27:13-44).

During Paul's second missionary journey, he and his companions traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, where they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in the province of Asia (Acts 16:6). On his third missionary journey, Paul passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia again, strengthening the disciples (Acts 18:23). In the closing of Paul's first letter to Timothy, he mentions that some have wandered from the faith, including Phygelus and Hermogenes, who were likely from Phrygia (2 Tim. 1:15). The mention of Phrygia in these passages highlights the spread of Christianity beyond Judea and the importance of the region in the early church's growth.",

It was at this location that God instructed Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea, causing the waters to divide and allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground (Exod. 14:15-16, 21-22). The Egyptians pursued them into the sea, but God brought the waters back upon them, drowning Pharaoh's entire army (Exod. 14:23-28).

Benaiah, in particular, was a highly esteemed warrior who commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites, and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne (2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kgs. 1:8, 38, 44).

During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, they camped in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Moab, where Moses delivered his final instructions and warnings to the people (Deut. 4:44-46). God instructed Moses to go up to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, and view the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites (Deut. 3:27; 34:1). From this vantage point, Moses was able to see the Promised Land, from Gilead to Dan, and all the lands of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, Judah, and the Negev (Deut. 34:1-3). After viewing the land, Moses died there in the land of Moab, and God buried him in a valley opposite Beth-peor (Deut. 34:5-6). The slopes of Pisgah are also mentioned as part of the territory conquered by the Israelites and allocated to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Num. 21:20; Josh. 12:3; 13:20). The significance of Pisgah lies in its association with Moses' final moments and its panoramic view of the Promised Land, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promise to His people.",

Pishon is said to wind through the entire land of Havilah, a region known for its abundance of gold, bdellium (a fragrant resin), and onyx stone (Gen. 2:11-12). The name \"Pishon\" is thought to derive from the Hebrew root \"puwsh,\" meaning \"to scatter, spread, or spring forward,\" possibly indicating that the river originated from a spring and formed a delta. Despite attempts to identify Pishon with various modern-day rivers, such as the Nile, Indus, or Ganges, its exact location remains unknown, as the geography described in the Eden account is difficult to reconcile with the current landscape. Some scholars suggest that the Pishon and the other rivers of Eden may have symbolic or allegorical significance, representing the life-giving power and abundance that flowed from God's presence in the garden.",

Despite the opposition, the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region (Acts 13:49). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pisidia again, strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain faithful (Acts 14:21-23).

Jeremiah was told to shatter an earthenware jar in front of the elders and priests as a symbol of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and its people (Jer. 19:10-11). The Potsherd Gate likely received its name from the fragments of broken pottery (potsherds) that were discarded in the nearby valley.

It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 28:13). After sailing from Malta, where they had been shipwrecked, Paul and his companions arrived at Syracuse and then proceeded to Rhegium. From there, they sailed to Puteoli, where they found some Christian brothers and stayed with them for seven days (Acts 28:13-14). Puteoli was a significant harbor and commercial center, serving as a gateway to Rome. It was also a major hub for the grain trade from Egypt, which was vital for supplying food to the populous city of Rome. The presence of a Christian community in Puteoli indicates the spread of the gospel in Italy, even before Paul's arrival in Rome. Paul's stay in Puteoli for a week suggests that he had the opportunity to fellowship with and encourage the local believers before continuing his journey to Rome, where he would await trial before Caesar.",

This identification is based on the association of Raamah with Sheba, a kingdom known for its wealth and located in the southern Arabian Peninsula.

The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war (Exod. 1:9-10). The exact location of Raamses is debated, but it is generally associated with the city of Pi-Ramesses (House of Ramesses), the capital of Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC. Pi-Ramesses was located in the eastern Nile Delta, near the modern-day city of Qantir. The name \"Raamses\" is thought to be derived from the name of Pharaoh Ramesses II, who was known for his extensive building projects. The mention of Raamses in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.",

In the story of the Levite and his concubine, the Levite planned to spend the night in Ramah before the tragic events in Gibeah (Judg. 19:13). Later, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, he fortified Ramah to prevent people from going to or coming from Judah (1 Kgs. 15:17, 21-22; 2 Chr. 16:1, 5-6). The town was also mentioned in the context of the return of the exiles from Babylon (Ezra 2:26; Neh. 7:30) and as one of the settlements where the Benjamites lived after the exile (Neh. 11:33). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea mentioned Ramah in their prophecies, often in connection with judgment or mourning (Isa. 10:29; Jer. 31:15; 40:1; Hos. 5:8). In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel quotes Jeremiah's prophecy about Rachel weeping for her children in Ramah, applying it to Herod's massacre of the infants in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:18).

However, when the Philistines came to capture him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he broke free from his bonds. He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and used it to strike down a thousand Philistines (Judg. 15:14-16). The place where this event occurred was called Ramath-lehi, which means \"hill of the jawbone\" or \"jawbone height\" (Judg. 15:17).

King Solomon later built a fleet of ships on the Red Sea at Ezion-geber (1 Ki. 9:26).

In the ensuing battle, the Benjamites were defeated, and the survivors escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months (Jdg. 20:45, 47). Later, the Israelites sent a peace delegation to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon, urging them to return (Jdg. 21:13). The exact location of the rock of Rimmon is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.",

It was the seat of power for the vast empire that ruled over much of the known world during the time of Jesus and the early church. Rome is mentioned in various contexts throughout the book of Acts and the epistles. Paul, as a Roman citizen, appealed to Caesar and was brought to Rome to stand trial (Acts 25:11-12; 28:16). He spent at least two years under house arrest in Rome, during which time he wrote several epistles (Acts 28:30-31; Eph. 6:20; Phil. 1:13; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1:1). Paul also expressed his desire to visit the church in Rome (Acts 19:21; Rom. 1:10-15; 15:23-24). The church in Rome, though not founded by Paul, was well-established and included both Jewish and Gentile believers (Acts 28:17-28; Rom. 1:7; 16:3-16). Rome was also the place where Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews, including Aquila and Priscilla, leading them to settle in Corinth (Acts 18:2). Tradition holds that both Paul and Peter were martyred in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. The city of Rome, with its political and cultural significance, served as a strategic center for the spread of the gospel and the growth of the early church.",

The city served as the royal residence and the center of political power for the northern kingdom until its fall to the Assyrians in 722 BC (2 Ki. 17:5-6). After the Assyrian conquest, the region of Samaria was repopulated with people from various parts of the Assyrian Empire (2 Ki. 17:24), who intermarried with the remaining Israelites and became known as Samaritans. ¶The Samaritans developed their own religious practices, which combined elements of Israelite tradition with foreign customs (2 Ki. 17:26-28). They worshipped at Mount Gerizim instead of Jerusalem (Jhn. 4:20) and accepted only the first five books of the Bible as authoritative. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus encountered a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well (Jhn. 4:7-26) and used a Samaritan as an example of compassion in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luk. 10:33). The early church spread to Samaria through the ministry of Philip (Acts 8:5-25), and the apostles Peter and John later visited the region (Acts 8:14-17). ¶Throughout the Bible, Samaria and the Samaritans are often portrayed as being in tension with the Jews due to religious and cultural differences (Jhn. 4:9; 8:48). However, Jesus and the early church demonstrated that the gospel was meant for all people, including the Samaritans.",

It was inhabited by the Horites before the descendants of Esau, the Edomites, dispossessed them (Gen. 14:6; Deut. 2:12, 22). ¶Seir is closely associated with Esau and his descendants, the Edomites (Gen. 32:3; 33:14, 16; 36:8, 9). It is often used interchangeably with Edom to refer to the nation that emerged from Esau's lineage (Gen. 36:30; Num. 24:18; Deut. 2:4, 8, 29; Josh. 24:4). ¶The region of Seir played a role in several biblical events. It was the location where the kings of the East fought against the Horites (Gen. 14:6). Moses and the Israelites passed through Seir during their wilderness wanderings, but were instructed not to provoke the Edomites to war (Deut. 1:44; 2:4, 8). Later, during the divided monarchy, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela, a stronghold in Seir (2 Chr. 25:11, 14). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel also mention Seir in their oracles, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom (Isa. 21:11; Ezek. 25:8). The region's rugged terrain and strategic location made it a formidable challenge for invading armies and a symbol of Edom's strength and pride.",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of the Israelites' interactions with the Edomites during their wilderness wanderings and later in their history. ¶Mount Seir is first mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy, where it is described as an eleven-day journey from Horeb (Sinai) by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea (Deut. 1:2). The Israelites were instructed to turn away from Mount Seir and pass through the territory of their brothers, the descendants of Esau, without provoking them (Deut. 2:1, 5). ¶During the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came against Judah by way of Mount Seir (2 Chr. 20:10, 22, 23). However, God caused these enemies to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat and the deliverance of Judah. ¶The prophet Ezekiel also delivered oracles against Mount Seir, declaring God's judgment against the Edomites for their hostility towards Israel (Ezek. 35:2, 3, 7, 15). This judgment would result in the desolation of Mount Seir and the recognition of God's sovereignty. ¶The specific location of Mount Seir within the region of Seir is not clearly defined in the Bible. However, its association with the Edomites and its strategic importance in military campaigns suggest that it was a prominent and well-fortified area within the mountainous region of Seir.",

The exact location of Sepharad is uncertain, but many scholars believe it refers to Sardis, an ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia and later became an important city in the Persian and Roman empires. ¶In the book of Revelation, Sardis is mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed by Jesus (Rev. 1:11; 3:1, 4). The church in Sardis is rebuked for its spiritual deadness and is called to repent and strengthen what remains (Rev. 3:1-3). However, there were a few faithful believers in Sardis who had not defiled their garments, and they are promised to walk with Jesus in white (Rev. 3:4). ¶If Sepharad and Sardis are indeed the same place, the reference in Obadiah suggests that a Jewish community existed there, possibly as a result of the Babylonian exile. The mention of Sardis in Revelation highlights the city's significance in early Christian history and the challenges faced by the church in that location.",

During the reign of King David, Sharon was known for its herds of cattle, overseen by Shitrai the Sharonite (1 Chr. 27:29). The prophet Isaiah used Sharon as a symbol of fruitfulness and blessing, contrasting it with the desolation brought by God's judgment (Isa. 33:9; 65:10). In the New Testament, the plain of Sharon is mentioned in connection with the ministry of the apostle Peter, who healed Aeneas in Lydda and proclaimed the gospel throughout the region (Acts 9:35). The fertile soil and moderate climate of Sharon made it a prosperous agricultural area, supporting a variety of crops and livestock. Its location along the coastal trade routes also contributed to its economic significance in ancient Israel.",

Intrigued by reports of Solomon's wisdom and prosperity, the queen journeyed to Jerusalem with a great caravan, bearing gifts of gold, spices, and precious stones. She tested Solomon with hard questions and was impressed by his wisdom and the splendor of his court. The queen praised Solomon and his God, acknowledging the divine source of his wisdom and success. ¶Sheba is also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts, often as a symbol of distant and exotic lands (Ps. 72:10; Isa. 60:6; Ezek. 38:13). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Queen of the South (Sheba) as one who will rise up in judgment against those who reject His message, emphasizing her recognition of wisdom and truth (Luke 11:31). ¶The kingdom of Sheba played a significant role in the trade networks of the ancient Near East, and its mention in the Bible attests to its fame and influence during the biblical period.",

The name \"Shebarim\" means \"the breaks\" or \"the quarries,\" possibly indicating a rocky or broken landscape that made escape difficult. ¶The mention of Shebarim in this narrative highlights the consequences of disobedience and sin within the Israelite camp. Achan's violation of God's command led to defeat and humiliation at the hands of a smaller enemy force. The pursuit of the Israelites to Shebarim underscores the extent of their defeat and the vulnerability caused by their failure to uphold God's standards of holiness.",

        "ext_description": "Shechem was an important city in central Canaan, located in the hill country between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Bible, often in connection with significant events in Israel's history. ¶Shechem first appears in the account of Abraham's journey to Canaan, where he built an altar to the Lord (Gen. 12:6-7). Later, Jacob settled near Shechem and purchased a piece of land, setting up an altar there (Gen. 33:18-20). However, the city also became the site of violence when Jacob's daughter Dinah was violated by Shechem, the son of Hamor, leading to the massacre of the city's male inhabitants by Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi (Gen. 34). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Shechem was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim and designated as a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7; 21:21). Joshua gathered the tribes at Shechem to renew the covenant and set up a stone of remembrance (Josh. 24:1, 25-26). The city later became the site of Abimelech's short-lived kingdom (Judg. 9) and was rebuilt by Jeroboam as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel (1 Ki. 12:25). ¶Shechem held religious significance, as evidenced by the blessings and curses pronounced from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33). The city is also mentioned in the Psalms as a symbol of God's dominion over Israel (Ps. 60:6; 108:7). ¶In the New Testament, Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrin mentions Shechem as the burial place of Jacob and his sons (Acts 7:16), although this differs from the Old Testament account of their burial at Hebron (Gen. 49:29-33; 50:13). ¶Shechem's location at the crossroads of major trade routes contributed to its strategic and economic importance. The city's history, marked by both sacred events and periods of violence, reflects the complex dynamics of Israelite settlement and inter-tribal relations in Canaan.",

In the time of Nehemiah, the wall of Jerusalem was repaired near the Pool of Shelah (Neh. 3:15), and Nehemiah himself inspected the walls by the King's Pool (Neh. 2:14). The prophet Isaiah used the gently flowing waters of Shiloah as a metaphor for the calm and trust in God, in contrast to the mighty waters of the Euphrates, symbolizing the Assyrian threat (Isa. 8:6). ¶In the New Testament, Jesus healed a man born blind by sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam (John 9:7, 11). This miracle not only demonstrated Jesus' power but also served as a spiritual lesson about faith and the true identity of the Messiah. The Gospel of Luke also records an incident where eighteen people were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them (Luke 13:4), using this event to teach about the need for repentance. ¶The Pool of Siloam has been identified with the archaeological site known as the Siloam Pool, which was discovered in 2004. Excavations have revealed a large pool from the Second Temple period, consistent with the biblical descriptions and historical accounts of the site.",

During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and the Israelites fought against the kings of the Shephelah (Josh. 9:1; 10:40; 11:2, 16; 12:8). The region was allotted to the tribes of Judah and Dan (Josh. 15:33; Judg. 1:9). ¶The Shephelah was renowned for its fertility and agricultural productivity. It was a region where wheat, barley, grapes, and olives were cultivated (1 Chr. 27:28; 2 Chr. 26:10). The abundance of sycamore and cedar trees in the Shephelah was compared to the abundance of stones during Solomon's reign (1 Ki. 10:27; 2 Chr. 1:15; 9:27). ¶The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah mention the Shephelah in their prophecies, highlighting its importance and the restoration of its cities and villages (Jer. 17:26; 32:44; 33:13; Zech. 7:7). The prophet Obadiah also foretells that the people of the Shephelah will possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria (Obad. 1:19). ¶The Shephelah played a significant role in the history of ancient Israel, serving as a region of strategic, agricultural, and prophetic importance. Its fertile valleys and proximity to major trade routes made it a valuable and contested area throughout the biblical period.",

It was at Shiloh that the land was allotted to the tribes of Israel (Josh. 18:8-10; 21:2) and where the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh were dismissed to their territories east of the Jordan (Josh. 22:9, 12). ¶During the time of the judges, Shiloh continued to be a significant religious site. The tabernacle remained at Shiloh throughout this period (Judg. 18:31), and annual festivals were held there (Judg. 21:19, 21). It was at Shiloh that Hannah prayed for a son and dedicated Samuel to the Lord's service (1 Sam. 1:3, 9, 24). The priest Eli and his sons ministered at the tabernacle in Shiloh (1 Sam. 2:14; 3:21; 4:3, 4, 12), and the Ark of the Covenant was kept there until it was captured by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3, 4). ¶Shiloh's importance declined after the Ark was taken and the tabernacle was destroyed (Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). The prophet Ahijah, who prophesied the division of the kingdom, was from Shiloh (1 Ki. 11:29; 14:2, 4). The town was eventually destroyed, and its ruins served as a warning against disobedience to God (Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). ¶Shiloh's significance in the biblical narrative lies in its role as a religious and political center during the formative years of Israel's history. Its central location in the hill country of Ephraim made it a convenient meeting place for the tribes and a symbol of their unity under the worship of the Lord.",

The Philistines gathered their forces at Shunem, while Saul and the Israelites camped at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. 28:4). It was during this time that Saul, in desperation, sought out a medium to consult the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel (1 Sam. 28:7-25). ¶The town of Shunem was strategically located along the main trade route connecting the Jezreel Valley with the coastal plain.

In the time of King Saul, he defeated the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt (1 Sam. 15:7).

When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their men fell into these tar pits, while the rest escaped to the hills. This allowed the eastern kings to seize the goods and provisions of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as capture Lot, Abraham's nephew, who was living in Sodom (Gen. 14:11-12). ¶The exact location of the Valley of Siddim is uncertain, as the geography of the region has undergone significant changes since biblical times. Some scholars believe that it may have been located in the area now covered by the southern basin of the Dead Sea, which is much shallower than the northern basin. Others propose that it could have been situated in the nearby plain, south of the Dead Sea. ¶The mention of the Valley of Siddim in the Bible is significant, as it sets the stage for Abraham's rescue of Lot and his subsequent encounter with Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High (Gen. 14:13-20). This event demonstrates Abraham's faith, courage, and loyalty to his family, as well as his reverence for Melchizedek, a figure who foreshadows the priesthood of Christ (Heb. 7:1-10).",

The exact location of Silla is unknown, but it was likely a place in or near Jerusalem, possibly a road or a district in the city. Some scholars propose that Silla may be related to the Hebrew word \"mesillah,\" meaning \"highway\" or \"causeway,\" suggesting that it could have been a major thoroughfare. The assassination of Joash at Silla marked the end of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his son Amaziah (2 Ki. 12:21).

The people had been grumbling against Moses and Aaron due to the lack of food, and God responded by miraculously supplying them with sustenance. The manna, described as a fine, flake-like substance, appeared every morning except on the Sabbath, and the Israelites were instructed to gather only as much as they needed for each day. ¶The Israelites left the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink (Exod. 17:1). Once again, the people complained against Moses, and God instructed him to strike the rock at Horeb, which miraculously provided water for the entire congregation (Exod. 17:5-7). ¶In the list of the Israelites' campsites recorded in the Book of Numbers, the Wilderness of Sin is mentioned between the campsites of Dophkah and Alush (Num. 33:11-12). ¶The experiences of the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sin, including the provision of manna and water, served as important lessons about God's faithfulness, providence, and the importance of trusting in Him. These events also foreshadowed the spiritual sustenance that God would provide through Jesus Christ, the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-35).",

It is the mountain where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments, as well as other laws and instructions for the Israelites. ¶After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites camped at the base of Mount Sinai for about a year (Exod. 19:1-2). During this time, God called Moses to the top of the mountain and spoke to him, giving him the Ten Commandments and other laws (Exod. 19-31). The mountain was filled with smoke, fire, and thunder, symbolizing the awesome presence of God (Exod. 19:16-19). ¶Moses spent forty days and forty nights on the mountain, receiving instructions from God and writing down the laws (Exod. 24:18; 34:28). He also received the two stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments (Exod. 31:18; 34:1, 4, 28-29). ¶The location of Mount Sinai is not specified in the Bible, but tradition has identified it with Jebel Musa (Mountain of Moses) in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula. However, some scholars have proposed alternative locations, such as Jebel al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia, based on various geographical and archaeological considerations. ¶Throughout the Bible, Sinai is mentioned as a symbol of God's revelation, covenant, and law (Deut. 33:2; Judg. 5:5; Ps. 68:8, 17; Neh. 9:13; Mal. 4:4). In the New Testament, Paul uses Sinai as an allegory for the old covenant, in contrast to the new covenant represented by the heavenly Jerusalem (Gal. 4:24-25). ¶The events at Sinai, including the giving of the Ten Commandments and the establishment of the Mosaic covenant, were pivotal moments in the history of Israel and laid the foundation for their identity as God's chosen people.",

        "ext_description": "Siphmoth is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the context of David's distribution of the spoils after his victory over the Amalekites (1 Sam. 30:28). After rescuing his wives and the families of his men from the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag, David sent gifts from the plunder to the elders of various towns in Judah, including Siphmoth. This gesture was likely intended to strengthen David's relationships with these towns and gain their support as he sought to establish his kingdom. The exact location of Siphmoth is unknown, but it was probably situated in the southern part of Judah, near other towns mentioned in the same passage, such as Aroer, Eshtemoa, and Hormah. The name \"Siphmoth\" may be derived from the Hebrew word \"sapham,\" meaning \"to cover\" or \"to hide,\" possibly indicating a concealed or protected location. However, the significance of the name remains uncertain due to the limited information provided in the biblical text.",

Abner, who had been the commander of Saul's army, had recently defected to David's side after a dispute with Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. Joab, David's military commander, held a grudge against Abner for killing his brother Asahel in battle (2 Sam. 2:18-23). ¶When Abner left David's presence at Hebron, Joab sent messengers after him and brought him back from the Cistern of Sirah. Upon Abner's return, Joab took him aside and stabbed him to death in revenge for his brother's killing (2 Sam. 3:27). ¶The exact location of Sirah is not specified in the biblical text, but it was apparently a well-known landmark near Hebron. The name \"Sirah\" may be derived from the Hebrew word \"sur,\" meaning \"to turn aside\" or \"to depart,\" possibly indicating a place where travelers would stop or turn off the main road. ¶David, who had not authorized Abner's murder, mourned his death and publicly cursed Joab and his family for their treachery (2 Sam. 3:28-39). This incident highlights the complex political situation during the early years of David's reign and the challenges he faced in uniting the kingdom under his rule.",

After the Philistines had stopped up the wells that Abraham's servants had dug, Isaac began to reopen them. He also dug new wells, including one he named Sitnah. ¶The name \"Sitnah\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"satan,\" meaning \"accusation\" or \"enmity.\" This name was given to the well because the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming the water as their own. ¶The dispute over the well at Sitnah was part of a larger pattern of conflict between Isaac and the Philistines. The Philistines, envious of Isaac's prosperity, had stopped up the wells and sent him away (Gen. 26:14-16). Despite these challenges, Isaac persisted in his efforts to establish himself in the land, trusting in God's promise to bless him and his descendants. ¶The story of Isaac's wells, including Sitnah, illustrates the challenges faced by the patriarchs as they sought to maintain their presence in Canaan. It also highlights the importance of water rights in the semi-arid region and the potential for conflict over these valuable resources.",

In the letter to the church of Smyrna, Jesus Christ acknowledges the church's suffering, poverty, and the blasphemy they faced from those who claimed to be Jews but were actually a \"synagogue of Satan\" (Rev. 2:9). ¶Despite their hardships, the church of Smyrna remained faithful to Christ. Jesus encourages them not to fear the impending persecution, which would include imprisonment and testing for \"ten days\" (Rev. 2:10). This may refer to a specific period of intense persecution or symbolize a limited time of trial. ¶Christ exhorts the church to remain faithful even unto death, promising them the \"crown of life\" as a reward for their steadfast endurance (Rev. 2:10). He also assures them that those who overcome will not be harmed by the \"second death,\" which is eternal separation from God (Rev. 2:11). ¶Smyrna was known for its beauty, commerce, and loyalty to Rome. It had a large Jewish population, which may have contributed to the persecution faced by the early Christian church there. The city was also a center of emperor worship, which likely created additional pressure for Christians who refused to participate in these pagan rituals. ¶The message to the church of Smyrna serves as an encouragement to all believers who face persecution and hardship for their faith. It reminds them that their ultimate loyalty is to Christ and that eternal life awaits those who remain faithful to Him.",

It was in this valley that David, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones, defeated the giant Goliath, leading to a great victory for Israel (1 Sam. 17:40-54). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Socoh was included in the district overseen by Ben-hesed, one of the twelve officers responsible for providing food for the king and his household (1 Ki. 4:10). ¶Later, when Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king, he fortified Socoh as part of his efforts to strengthen the defenses of Judah (2 Chr. 11:7).

It was located close to Jacob's well, where Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down and engaged in a conversation with a Samaritan woman (John 4:6-26). This encounter led to many Samaritans from the city believing in Jesus as the Christ (John 4:39-42). The exact location of Sychar is debated, but it is often identified with the modern village of Askar, situated about half a mile northeast of Jacob's well.",

However, in later years, Syrian kings often posed a threat to Israel and Judah, forming alliances against them (1 Kgs. 15:18-20; 2 Kgs. 16:5-9). The Arameans, the inhabitants of Syria, are mentioned as worshipping foreign gods (Judg. 10:6). In the New Testament, Syria is mentioned in connection with the spread of the gospel and the early church (Acts 15:23, 41; Gal. 1:21). The apostle Paul spent time in Syria during his missionary journeys (Acts 18:18; 21:3). A Syrophoenician woman is mentioned in Mark 7:26, highlighting Jesus' ministry in the region. Syria played a significant role in the history of Israel and the early church.",

The \"ships of Tarshish\" became a symbol of wealth and commercial power (Isa. 2:16; 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezek. 27:25). Tarshish was a source of silver, iron, tin, and lead (Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12). It was also associated with other distant and exotic locations, such as Sheba and Seba (Ps. 72:10). The exact location of Tarshish is uncertain, but many scholars believe it was situated in southern Spain, possibly near the ancient Phoenician colony of Tartessus. In the book of Jonah, the prophet attempts to flee from God's presence by sailing to Tarshish, emphasizing its distance from Israel (Jonah 1:3). The wealth and splendor of Tarshish are used as a metaphor for God's judgment (Isa. 23:6, 10; Ezek. 38:13). Despite its prominence, Tarshish would ultimately be subject to God's sovereignty (Ps. 48:7).",

In the time of Jehoshaphat, the people of Judah gathered in the wilderness of Tekoa to seek God's help against their enemies (2 Chr. 20:20). The town was also involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Neh. 3:5, 27).

The exact location of Tema is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, along the trade routes connecting Arabia with Mesopotamia and the Levant. The Tema oasis was a significant stopover for caravans, providing water and provisions for travelers.

Ezekiel foretold the destruction of Thebes, stating that God would execute judgments against the city (Ezek. 30:14-16).

Paul preached in the synagogue for three Sabbaths, reasoning from the Scriptures about Jesus as the Messiah. Some Jews and a large number of God-fearing Greeks, including prominent women, believed and joined Paul and Silas. However, jealous Jews formed a mob and caused an uproar in the city, accusing Paul and Silas of defying Caesar's decrees. The believers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. Despite the opposition, a strong church was established in Thessalonica. Paul later wrote two epistles to the Thessalonian church, addressing their concerns and encouraging them in their faith (1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1). Thessalonica is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travels and ministry (Acts 20:4; 27:2; Phil. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:10).",

She encountered the apostle Paul in Philippi and became a convert to Christianity (Acts 16:14-15). Thyatira is also mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:11). In the letter to the church in Thyatira, the risen Christ commends the believers for their love, faith, service, and patient endurance (Rev. 2:18-19). However, he also rebukes them for tolerating a false prophetess, symbolically referred to as \"Jezebel,\" who promoted sexual immorality and idolatry (Rev. 2:20-23). The faithful in Thyatira are encouraged to hold fast until Christ's return, with the promise of authority over the nations for those who overcome (Rev. 2:24-28).",

Daniel, who had been exiled to Babylon, was standing on the bank of the Tigris when he saw a man dressed in linen and heard a message concerning future events. The Tigris River originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and flows through Iraq before joining the Euphrates to form the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. The river was important for ancient civilizations such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, providing water for irrigation and serving as a major transportation route.",

The city was later captured by the Philistines during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah (2 Chr. 28:18). Timnah was situated in the Sorek Valley, known for its fertile land and strategic location on trade routes. ¶The Timnites are mentioned in Judges 15:6 as the people of the Philistine city of Timnah. Samson, one of the judges of Israel, had married a Philistine woman from Timnah. However, during the wedding feast, Samson posed a riddle to the Philistine guests, which they could not solve. They threatened Samson's wife to reveal the answer, which she did. In anger, Samson killed thirty Philistine men and left his wife. Later, when Samson attempted to visit his wife, he discovered that her father had given her to another man. In revenge, Samson burned the Philistines' fields, vineyards, and olive groves. The Timnites retaliated by burning Samson's wife and her father to death. This escalated the conflict between Samson and the Philistines.",

In Micah 4:8, the prophet addresses the Tower of the Flock, associating it with the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of the kingdom to Jerusalem. This passage has led some interpreters to view the Tower of Eder as a prophetic symbol of the birthplace of the Messiah, linking it to the fields near Bethlehem where the shepherds received the announcement of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:8-20).

The region was known for its caves, which were often used as hideouts by robbers. Herod the Great had previously routed out these robbers to maintain order in the area. After Philip's death, Trachonitis was briefly annexed to the province of Syria before being given to Agrippa I by Caligula. The exact boundaries of Trachonitis are not clearly defined in the Bible, but it is generally associated with the modern-day Leja' region in southern Syria.",

During his second missionary journey, Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia pleading with him to come and help them while he was in Troas (Acts 16:8-10). This vision prompted Paul and his companions to sail from Troas to Macedonia, marking a significant expansion of the gospel into Europe. Later, during his third missionary journey, Paul spent a week in Troas, where he preached late into the night (Acts 20:5-12). During this visit, a young man named Eutychus fell asleep and fell from a window, but Paul raised him back to life. Paul also visited Troas on other occasions (2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13), indicating the city's importance as a strategic location for his ministry.",

The city is first mentioned in the Bible as part of the boundary of the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:29). Tyre's king, Hiram, provided cedar, cypress timber, and skilled workers to David for his palace (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1) and to Solomon for the construction of the Temple (1 Kgs. 5:1; 9:11-12; 2 Chr. 2:3-16). Despite this friendly relationship, Tyre is often denounced by the prophets for its pride, idolatry, and oppression of God's people (Isa. 23; Jer. 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezek. 26-28; Amos 1:9-10). Ezekiel prophesied the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar (Ezek. 26) and its eventual restoration and dedication of its wealth to God (Isa. 23:17-18). In the New Testament, Jesus visited the region of Tyre and Sidon and performed miracles there (Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24-31). He also used Tyre and Sidon as examples of cities that would have repented if they had witnessed the miracles performed in Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21-22; Luke 10:13-14). The apostle Paul visited Tyre during his missionary journeys (Acts 21:3-7). Throughout the Bible, Tyre is portrayed as a symbol of wealth, trade, and worldly influence, often contrasted with the values of God's kingdom.",

In Daniel's vision, he finds himself beside the Ulai Canal, where he sees a ram with two horns standing beside the river (Dan. 8:3). The ram is later interpreted as representing the kings of Media and Persia (Dan. 8:20). As the vision continues, Daniel sees a male goat coming from the west, which defeats the ram (Dan. 8:5-7). The goat is interpreted as the king of Greece (Dan. 8:21). The Ulai River is mentioned again when the angel Gabriel approaches Daniel to explain the vision (Dan. 8:16). The river's location in Elam, combined with the mention of Susa, suggests that the Ulai may be associated with the ancient city of Susa, which served as one of the capitals of the Persian Empire. The Ulai River is thus connected with important prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel, which foretell the rise and fall of major world empires and their impact on God's people.",

It is best known as the hometown of Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites. According to Genesis, Abraham (then called Abram) lived in Ur with his father Terah, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot (Gen. 11:28-31). God called Abraham to leave Ur and go to the land of Canaan, promising to make him a great nation and a blessing to all the families of the earth (Gen. 12:1-3). Abraham obeyed and set out from Ur, traveling first to Haran and then to Canaan (Gen. 11:31; 12:4-5). Later, when God confirms His covenant with Abraham, He reminds him that He brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give him the land of Canaan (Gen. 15:7). The city of Ur is also mentioned in Nehemiah 9:7, where the Levites recount God's faithfulness in bringing Abraham out of Ur and making a covenant with him. Archaeologists have identified the ancient city of Ur with modern-day Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq, which was once a thriving center of Sumerian civilization. The biblical account of Abraham's origins in Ur highlights God's sovereign plan in calling and guiding His chosen people from the very beginning.",

Nehemiah inspected the Valley Gate during his nighttime survey of the city's damaged walls (Neh. 2:13, 15). Later, during the rebuilding process, Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, including its doors, bolts, and bars (Neh. 3:13).

The Valley Gate's mention in both historical and post-exilic accounts highlights its importance in the defense and security of Jerusalem throughout different periods of the city's history.",

They stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer's Field, and called for the king. The Washer's Field was likely an area outside the city walls where launderers washed and dried clothes, taking advantage of the water supply from the nearby pool. The prophet Isaiah also mentions the Washer's Field in an earlier prophecy (Isa. 7:3), where God instructs him to meet King Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Washer's Field, to deliver a message of reassurance concerning the impending Assyrian threat.

The rugged terrain of Wildgoats Rocks provided numerous hiding places for David and his men, making it difficult for Saul to locate them.

The verse states that Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanannim. This reference to Zaanannim occurs in the context of the story of Deborah and Barak, who led the Israelites in a battle against Sisera, the commander of King Jabin's army. Heber's wife, Jael, would later kill Sisera by driving a tent peg through his temple as he slept (Judg. 4:17-22). The exact location of Zaanannim is not certain, but its association with Kedesh and the Kenites suggests that it was situated in the northern region of Israel, near the border with Syria.",

In Isaiah 14:13, the king of Babylon is portrayed as aspiring to ascend to heaven and sit on the mount of assembly \"in the far reaches of the north\" (Zaphon), symbolizing his desire to usurp God's authority.

Upon arriving at the city gate, Elijah met the widow and asked her for water and bread. Despite her limited resources, the widow shared her last meal with Elijah, and as a result, her flour and oil miraculously never ran out until the end of the famine (1 Kgs. 17:10-16). Later, when the widow's son fell ill and died, Elijah prayed to God and raised the boy back to life (1 Kgs. 17:17-24). In the New Testament, Jesus references Elijah's stay in Zarephath as an example of God's grace extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles (Luke 4:26). The city is also mentioned in the Book of Obadiah, where it is prophesied that the exiles of Israel will possess the land as far as Zarephath (Obad. 1:20).

The city is also mentioned in 1 Kings 4:12 to help locate Beth-Shean, which was in Solomon's fifth administrative district. Although the exact location of Zarethan is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated in the Jordan Valley, possibly on the west bank of the river. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Mazar (also known as Qerawa or Korea) near Mount Sartabe, while others suggest it may have been on the east bank.

Later, when God determined to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Zeboiim was also included in the destruction (Deut. 29:23).

The mention of Zeboim in this passage highlights the efforts of the returning exiles to reestablish their presence in the land and rebuild their communities after the Babylonian captivity.

The Wilderness of Zin formed part of the southern border of the land allotted to Judah (Jos.15:1,3). It marked the extreme southern limit of the Promised Land (Num.34:3-4). The Wilderness of Zin is also associated with Kadesh (Num.33:36), a significant site during Israel's wilderness journey.

The princes of Zoan are described as fools, unable to give wise counsel to Pharaoh (Isa.19:11,13). Zoan is also mentioned as a place where the rebellious Israelites sent messengers, seeking help from Egypt rather than trusting in God (Isa.30:4). Ezekiel prophesied that Zoan would be in terror and face God's judgment (Ezk.30:14). Zoan is most likely to be identified with Tanis, an important city in the Nile Delta region of ancient Egypt. It served as a capital during the 21st and 22nd dynasties.",
